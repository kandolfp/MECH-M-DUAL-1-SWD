# Scientific Computing {#sec-scientific-computing}

Scientific Computing, also known as computational science, technical computing, scientific computation is a field in science that uses computing capabilities to solve and understand complex (physical) problems. 
The field contains many categories including:

- Algorithms (numerical and non-numerical) for mathematical and computational modelling and computer based simulation form problems arising in sciences and humanities.
- Computer hardware to develop and optimize the advanced system hardware, firmware, network and data management such as High Performance Computing (HPC).
- Computing infrastructure to support sciences and engineering to solve their problems.

We can not hope to cover all of this but we can start by looking at some specific libraries in Python that help you deal with common task in scientific computing.
