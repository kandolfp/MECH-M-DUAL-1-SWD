    "text": "1.1 Getting started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Type along\n\n\n\nThis part is designed as a type along session!\n\n\nAs usual for programming guides, we start with:\n\nprint(\"Hello, World\")\n\nHello, World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese notes are generated from markdown and executable code (for a lot of the Python aspects). This means sometimes the results are part of the text, but if we need to make sure you can see the output we highlight it with some background color. For this reason and to make it easier to copy and past code from the notes we omit &gt;&gt;&gt; that you see in your REPL.\n\n\nLets break down what we did above6:\n\nwe called a function print - indicated by ( and ) respectively,\nwe handed the text Hello, World to that function - indicated by the two \",\nthe REPL returned the result and printed it on screen.\n\nThe text above is called a string and you can do operations with strings, like:\n\nprint(\"Hello,\" + \"World\")\nprint(\"Spam\" * 5)\n\nHello,World\nSpamSpamSpamSpamSpam\n\n\nHere + and * are so called operators. The first combines (concatenates) two strings, the second multiplies one string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe Style guide - PEP 8 tells us that an operator should have a leading and trailing white space.\n\n\nIn case we want to know more about the function print we can use another function to get some more insight:\n\nhelp(print)\n\nHelp on built-in function print in module builtins:\n\nprint(*args, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=None, flush=False)\n    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.\n\n    sep\n      string inserted between values, default a space.\n    end\n      string appended after the last value, default a newline.\n    file\n      a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.\n    flush\n      whether to forcibly flush the stream.\n\n\n\nNow let us pick up a bit of speed.\n\n1# Mathematical operators\n3 + 2\n2 * 10\n24 // 2    # Integer division\n4 / 3\n(9 + 8) * 32\n\n\n1\n\nWe can write comments, that get ignored by the interpreter. They start with #\n\n2\n\nComments can also follow a command\n\n\n\n\n544\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you copy and execute the code above your output will differ and look something like:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; # Mathematical operators\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 + 2\n5\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * 10\n20\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 // 2\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 4.0 / 2\n2.0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (9 + 8) * 32\n544\nThis is due to the fact that the system used to create these notes does not feed the input to the REPL one by one but rather as a script. Therefore, we will often just suppress the output or if we want to make sure something is printed in the notes we will use print explicitly.\n\n\nThere are the usual boolean operators for comparison:\n\n1 != 2\n1 &lt; 2\n2 &gt; 3\n1.0 &gt;= 1\n0.99 &lt;= 1\n\n# and combine them with logical operators\n(1.0 &lt;= 1) and (1.0 &gt;= 1)\n(2 &lt; 1) or (2 &gt; 1)\nnot (1 != 2)\n\nWe can assign a value to a variable and use them later on:\n\npi = 3.1415926535897932\nx = 90\n\n# Convert degree to radiant\nx_rad = x * (pi / 180)\n\n# Convert it back to degree\nx_new = x_rad * (180 / pi)\n\n# Check if they are the same\nx == x_new\n\nWe can also change the value of a variable:\n\n# We can make the printed statement more elaborate\nprint(\"x =\", x)\nx = 45.0\nprint(f\"x = {x}\")\nprint(f\"{x=}\")\n\nx = 90\nx = 45.0\nx=45.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPython is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is checked during runtime and not beforehand.\nAs a result you can change the type7 of a variable without the interpreter complaining about it. This is often the cause of strange bugs in programs so be aware that Python has types, even though we do not always see them.\n\n\nWe have simple simple control sequences that help us to run different code depending on a condition:\n\nif x &lt; 90:\n  x = x * 2      # This section gets executed if the statement is true\nelse:\n  x = x / 2      # And this if it is false\n\nprint(f\"x = {x}\")\n\nif x &lt; 45:\n  x = x * 2\nelif x &lt; 90:\n  x = x * 3      # If the first statement is false but the second true\nelse:\n  x = x ** 2     # If none of the above statements is true\nprint(f\"x = {x}\")\n\nx = 90.0\nx = 8100.0\n\n\nIn order to understand loops better we first need to introduce lists. In essence, they represent an ordered sequence of values that can have arbitrary types.\n\n# List of integers\n[2, 4, 6, 8]\n# List of strings\n[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\n# List of lists\n[[2, 4, 6, 8], [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]]\n# List of mixed types\n[2, \"A\"]\n# Assign a list to a variable\nintegers = [2, 4, 6, 8]\n# Changing values\nintegers[1] = -4\n# append something to a list\nintegers.append(10)\n# combine to lists\nintegers + [1, 3]\n\nThere are also functions that can generate specific types of lists for you. One such function is range, with the signature range(start, stop[, step]).\n\n# List of integers from 0 to 2\nrange(3)\n# List of integers from 5 to 9\nrange(5, 10)\n# List of integers from 10 to 1 in reverse order\nrange(10, 0, -1)\n\nrange(10, 0, -1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote that the stop value is not part of the list but rather stop -1 and technically range does not return a list but rather an object that behaves like a list for most parts.\n# Part of the help\n&gt;&gt;&gt; help(range)\n\nHelp on class range in module builtins:\n\nclass range(object)\n |  range(stop) -&gt; range object\n |  range(start, stop[, step]) -&gt; range object\n |  \n |  Return an object that produces a sequence of integers from start (inclusive)\n |  to stop (exclusive) by step.  range(i, j) produces i, i+1, i+2, ..., j-1.\n |  start defaults to 0, and stop is omitted!  range(4) produces 0, 1, 2, 3.\n |  These are exactly the valid indices for a list of 4 elements.\n |  When step is given, it specifies the increment (or decrement).\n\n\nNow let us introduce loops as part of our control sequences:\n\n# For loops work best with lists or sets\nsum = 0\nfor i in integers:\n  sum = sum + i\n\nmean = sum / len(integers)   # len computes the length of a list\nprint(mean)\n\n# Find out how many even and how many odd number are in a list\nodd = 0\neven = 0\nfor i in range(1, 10):\n  if i % 2:\n    even = even + 1\n  else:\n    odd = odd + 1\nprint(f\"{even=}, {odd=}\")\n\n# While loops run until a statement is no longer true\na = 5\nb = 2\nc = 1\nwhile (a &gt; 0):\n  a = a - 1\n  c = c * b\nprint(f\"{b}^5 = {c}\")\n\n4.4\neven=5, odd=4\n2^5 = 32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThere is an internal function called sum and we just overwrote this function, so be careful how you choose your variable names.\n\n\nOf course there are easier ways to compute the sum of a list or \\(2^5\\). For this we need to import additional functions:\n\nimport math\nmean = math.fsum(integers) / len(integers)\nprint(mean)\n\nc = math.pow(2, 5)\nprint(c)\n\n4.4\n32.0\n\n\nmath is one of the Python standard libraries, but quite often they do not suffice for the task at hand and you need some additional libraries.\nIn the next section we will discuss package managers and one possible solution for this.\nFurthermore, so far we only typed in the REPL and if we want to do the same again we need to retype everything. So we need to talk about script files which will lead us to version control.\nFor now, this ends our brief start with Python but you should try our new knowledge by finishing the following exercise.",

It reads project metadata from a standardized pyproject.toml file and supports lockfiles. Users can add additional functionality through plugins, which can be shared by uploading them as distributions.\nUnlike Poetry and Hatch, PDM is not limited to a specific build backend; users have the freedom to choose any build backend they prefer.\nSource: From the pdm-project on github, as of 9th of September 2024\n\nThe following screen cast gives us a quick overview of its capabilities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor this guide we closely follow the notes on the project page https://pdm-project.org/, please note that the original code and potential updates to it can be found there, see Ming (2019).\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Installation\nFirst we need to install pdm so that it is available (globally) on our system. For this to work, Python version 3.8 or later must be available on the system.\nThe recommended way is to use the provided install script.\n\nLinux/MacWindows\n\n\ncurl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -\n\n\n(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -\n\n\n\nOf course we do not just download a file from the internet without checking the content. At the time of writing the current sha256 is\ncdaae475a16ae781e06c7211c7b075df1b508470b0dc144bbb73acf9a8389f91  install-pdm.py\nsee install-pdm.py.sha256\nYou can check the file sha by calling:\n\nLinux/MacWindows\n\n\ncurl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | shasum -a 256\n\n\nGet-FileHash -InputStream (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py -UseBasicParsing).RawContentStream -Algorithm SHA256\n\n\n\nBy default, pdm is installed into the user space (depending on the platform), but this can be modified via arguments to the script, see the help option of the script.\n\n2.2.1.1 Optional - Shell completion\nFor a better user experience we would recommend to include the shell completion.\n\nBash (Linux)Zsh (Mac)Powershell (Windows)\n\n\npdm completion bash &gt; /etc/bash_completion.d/pdm.bash-completion\n\n\n# Make sure ~/.zfunc is added to fpath, before compinit.\npdm completion zsh &gt; ~/.zfunc/_pdm\n\n\n# Create a directory to store completion scripts\nmkdir $PROFILE\\..\\Completions\necho @'\nGet-ChildItem \"$PROFILE\\..\\Completions\\\" | ForEach-Object {\n    . $_.FullName\n}\n'@ | Out-File -Append -Encoding utf8 $PROFILE\n# Generate script\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser\npdm completion powershell | Out-File -Encoding utf8 $PROFILE\\..\\Completions\\pdm_completion.ps1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Start a new project\nLet us start a new project in a new directory:\n1$ mkdir test\nmkdir: created directory 'test'\n\n2$ cd test/\n\n1\n\ncreate a directory\n\n2\n\nchange into this directory\n\n\nIn order to start a new pdm project you can use pdm init. This will prompt you with a couple of questions and based on the answers the pyproject.toml file is initialized.\n1$ pdm init\nCreating a pyproject.toml for PDM...\n2Please enter the Python interpreter to use\n 0. cpython@3.11 (/usr/local/bin/python3)\n 1. cpython@3.12 (/usr/bin/python3.12)\n 2. cpython@3.11 (/usr/local/bin/python3.11)\n 3. cpython@3.8 (/usr/local/bin/python3.8)\nPlease select (0): 1\n3Virtualenv is created successfully at /tmp/test/.venv\n4Project name (test):\n5Project version (0.1.0):\n6Do you want to build this project for distribution(such as wheel)?\nIf yes, it will be installed by default when running `pdm install`. [y/n] (n): n\n7License(SPDX name) (MIT):\n8Author name (John Doe):\nAuthor email (John.Doe@generic.edu):\n9Python requires('*' to allow any) (==3.12.*):\nProject is initialized successfully\n\n1\n\nStart the initialization with pdm init.\n\n2\n\nWe need to select a python interpreter. pdm will search for all available interpreters on your path, if you need a different version than those available you can use pdm to install a new standalone python version, see pdm python command or the docs3.\n\n3\n\nBy default pdm will create a new virtualenv for you as this is the recommend procedure, if you want to influence this behavior see docs.\n\n4\n\nWe need to specify a project name. This name is used in the pyproject.toml and pdm will also generate a src/&lt;name&gt; directory for you right away (together with a test directory). pdm uses its default template, see docs.\n\n5\n\nThe version of your project needs to be initialized. pdm follows semantic versioning4 by default. If you do not have a specific version in mind stick to 0.1.0 for a new project.\n\n6\n\nNext we need to decide if we plan to distribute the project. For now n (no) will suffice, but hopefully by the end of these notes you feel comfortable enough to release your own package. Once this is the case, take a look at the docs and the Python Packaging User Guide.\n\n7\n\nLicensing is next. This is a rather important issue when you release software, but we need to postpone it as well. So stick to the default for now.\n\n8\n\nAuthor name and email can (and should) be a list if you have multiple contributors. pdm will try to figure out defaults from system settings.\n\n9\n\nFinally, you will be asked for the required python version. Here you can specify the compatibility of your project to various python versions5. For good reason, by default it will only allow the current version you selected in the first step. In theory you can specify something like &gt;=3.8,!=3.9.0,&lt;3.13 (a python version between 3.8 and 3.13, including 3.8 but excluding 3.13 and additionally excluding 3.9.0) but be aware that might become tricky when adding dependencies.\n\n\nNow you have a new project available and it should look like this:\n1$ tree -a\n.\n2├── .gitignore\n├── .pdm-python\n├── __pycache__\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── README.md\n├── src\n│   └── test\n│       ├── __init__.py\n│       └── __pycache__\n├── tests\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── __pycache__\n3└── .venv\n    ├── bin\n    │   ├── activate\n    │   ├── activate.csh\n    │   ├── activate.fish\n    │   ├── activate.nu\n4    │   ├── activate.ps1\n    │   ├── activate_this.py\n    │   ├── python -&gt; /usr/bin/python3.12\n    │   ├── python3 -&gt; python\n    │   └── python3.12 -&gt; python\n    ├── .gitignore          \n    ├── lib\n    │   └── python3.12\n    │       └── site-packages\n    │           ├── _virtualenv.pth\n    │           └── _virtualenv.py\n    └── pyvenv.cfg\n\n12 directories, 19 files\n\n1\n\nList all files in the directory\n\n2\n\nA .gitignore file is created\n\n3\n\nVirtual environment\n\n4\n\nWindows activation start file (cross platform)\n\n\nThe second highlighted section tells us that pdm is designed to work with a version control system. By default it uses git as seen by the .gitignore file highlighted. In this context:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must commit the pyproject.toml file. You should commit the pdm.lock and pdm.toml file. Do not commit the .pdm-python file.6\n\n\nTo check what setup pdm created for you, you can use the pdm info command, where the --env option provides us with more details about the environment/platform.\n$ pdm info\nPDM version:\n  2.18.1\nPython Interpreter:\n  /tmp/test/.venv/bin/python (3.12)\nProject Root:\n  /tmp/test\nLocal Packages:\n  \n$ pdm info --env\n{\n  \"implementation_name\": \"cpython\",\n  \"implementation_version\": \"3.12.3\",\n  \"os_name\": \"posix\",\n  \"platform_machine\": \"x86_64\",\n  \"platform_release\": \"6.8.0-41-generic\",\n  \"platform_system\": \"Linux\",\n  \"platform_version\": \"#41-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Aug  2 20:41:06 UTC 2024\",\n  \"python_full_version\": \"3.12.3\",\n  \"platform_python_implementation\": \"CPython\",\n  \"python_version\": \"3.12\",\n  \"sys_platform\": \"linux\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOf course it is also possible to import from other package manager systems, see docs.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Manage dependencies\nNow that the project exists we can look at the main task: managing packages. We will cover the basics that we need, for a full guide see Manage Dependencies at docs.\n\n2.2.3.1 Add dependencies\nTo add a dependency you can use the pdm add command, where the system follows the PEP 508 specifications.\npdm add requests           # add requests\npdm add requests==2.25.1   # add requests with version constraint\npdm add requests[socks]    # add requests with extra dependency\npdm add \"flask&gt;=1.0\" flask-sqlalchemy   # add multiple dependencies with different specifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy default pdm searches for dependencies on PyPI, see docs on how to add to or modify the package index.\nIf you are not sure how a package is called use pdm search to locate it (even though the search could be improved).\n\n\nIt is rather common for python dependencies to have dependencies on their own. pdm will make sure to install all of those as well. Everything that is installed will end up in the pdm.lock file with the exact version and where it comes from.\nIn contrast to other dependency management systems such as requirements.txt a very handy feature of pdm is that it will only add the specified dependencies to the pyproject.toml and not all sub-dependencies. This makes it easier for somebody else to keep track of what your actual dependencies are and especially for update procedures.\n\n2.2.3.1.1 Add local dependencies\nQuite often it happens that you develop a project and use it as a dependency in another project you are working on. In this case you want to have a local dependency. This can be added by calling:\npdm add ./my-project\nIt is important to mention, that the path must start with . otherwise it is not interpreted as a local dependency.\n\n\n\n2.2.3.2 Development dependencies\nWith pdm you can also define groups of dependencies that are particularly useful during development. This might be a linter, formatter, or tools for testing and creating the docs.\npdm add -dG lint flake8\nYou will find these dependencies in a special section in you pyproject.toml file, namely:\n[tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]\nlint = [\"flake8\"]\n\n\n2.2.3.3 Inspect dependencies\nIf you need to find out what your installed dependencies are you can use pdm list or pdm list --tree.\n$ pdm list --tree\nrequests 2.32.3 [ required: &gt;=2.32.3 ]\n├── certifi 2024.8.30 [ required: &gt;=2017.4.17 ]\n├── charset-normalizer 3.3.2 [ required: &lt;4,&gt;=2 ]\n├── idna 3.8 [ required: &lt;4,&gt;=2.5 ]\n└── urllib3 2.2.2 [ required: &lt;3,&gt;=1.21.1 ]\n\n\n2.2.3.4 Update dependencies\nIf you find that a package has released an update that is required for your project you can use pdm to update your packages:\npdm update\nwill update all packages (if possible) in your pdm.lock file, while\npdm update requests\nwill only update the specified dependency (you can specify multiple packages).\n\n\n2.2.3.5 Remove dependencies\nIf you have added a dependency but no longer need it, you can remove it by calling pdm remove. Note that all sub-dependencies will be removed as well.\n\n\n2.2.3.6 List outdated dependencies\nWith pdm outdated you get a list of outdated packages with the latest version available.\n\n\n2.2.3.7 Other dependencies than python packages\nIt might happen that your project needs additional dependencies other than python resources. In this case you can also use pdm to install a multitude of those.\nAs an example, you can install the Intel Math Kernel Library (mkl) and cmake by calling\npdm add mkl cmake\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Initialize an existing project\nIf the pdm project already exists, e.g. you just cloned a project, all you need to do is run\npdm install\nto check the project file for changes, update the lock file if needed and run pdm sync to install all packages from the lock file.\n\n\n2.2.5 Running your code\nAs mentioned throughout these notes, pdm uses virtualenv to manage your project. This means you need to activate the project to work with it.\nIf you simply want to run a python script in your environment use:\npdm run python &lt;SCRIPT.py&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;\nSimilar you can start the python console via:\npdm run python\nIf you need to work in your current terminal with the environment you created it is easier to use pdm venv activate which will tell you how to activate the enviroment in your current terminal. In bash you can use\neval $(pdm venv activate)\nto directly activate the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou should set up your IDE such that it searches for .venv directories for the python interpreter to make sure you do not get missing includes warnings and if you use the direct call or debug features you call the correct version.\n\n\nThis concludes our little guide for package managers in python. Make sure to revisit this sections and the pdm docs if you need them for the course of this section.\n\n\n\n\nMing, Frost. 2019. “PDM project site.” Online: Accessed 09-September-2024. https://pdm-project.org/.",

    "section": "3.1 Basics of Git",
    "text": "3.1 Basics of Git\nGit is a distributed VCS, which means the entire repository is distributed on various machines and possible multiple remotes. This was a clear design choice that allows individual contributors to work independently of the availability of a remote but still have the full history available. The following is based on the git training by the UnseenWizzard. The main structure as well as the basic idea in the pictures follows these notes, with a view adaptations where needed.\nIn particular, such a setup could look something like this:\n\n\n\nBasic setup\n\n\nIn this setup the Remote Repository is the place you send your changes to in order to have them visible for others, and in return you can get changes from them via the Remote Repository.\nLike the name suggests the Local (development) environment sits on your machine. The working directory is your current version of the files contained in the repository and the Local Repository is the copy of the entire repository (with all changes) on your machine. We will learn more about these parts as we go along.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will use the small exercise from the previous Python section as python_ex1.py file.\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Let us start with getting a Remote Repository\nIn order to allow a playfield for this class I created a repository that we are going to use. In order to get it onto you local machine, type the following commands in the Terminal:\n# Navigate to a suitable directory\ngit clone https://github.com/kandolfp/playground.git\nThis will perform the following two actions:\n\nCheckout the content of the remote repository into the working directory. By default this is the name of the repository, in your case the folder playground is created and all files are put there.\nA copy of the remote repository is stored in the local repository. For all intended purposes, it acts exactly the same as the Remote Repository, with the sole exception that is not shared with others.\n\n\n\n\nClone a remote repository to your machine\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Adding content\nWith the following snippet you can view the content of the repository (the second line is the response):\n&gt; ls playground\npython_ex1 README.md\nAs you can see there is currently only a README.md and the folder python_ex1.\nNow lets add our solutions of the exercises we did in Python to the repository.\nFirst we copy the file to exercise directory\ncp PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE/solution_ex1.py python_ex1/{YOUR ID}.py \nIn my case the command reads like this:\n&gt; cp ../Exercises/reference_solution.py python_ex1/ID.py\n'../Exercises/reference_solution.py' -&gt; 'python_ex1/ID.py'\nThis has modified our working directory. In order to get an idea what Git thinks about this lets run git status in the working directory:\nOn branch main\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n    python_ex1/ID.py\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nLets break down the output of the command. First, Git tells you which branch you are on (we will hear more about that later), second, that local repository is different from the remote repository and it states that you have tracked and untracked files.\nNow, a tracked files is a file that is part of the repository and Git is keeping track of what is happening to it. An untracked file on the other hand, is a file that is in the same directory but it is not managed by Git.\nGit tells you how to change the status of your untracked file into a tracked file.\nWe do this by running git add python_ex1/ID.py.\nNow it is time to introduce another Git concept, namely the staging area. The stating area is the curious white spot between your working directory and the local repository in the above pictures. This is the place where Git collects all the changes to your files that you want to put into the local repository.\n\n\n\nStaging area with the changes that can be moved to the repository\n\n\nBy rerunning git status we get\nOn branch main\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n    new file:   python_ex1/ID.py\nNow that we are confident that all our changes are in the staging area, we are ready to commit the changes to the local repository. This is done by running git commit. A text editor will open and you are able to write a message telling everybody what you just did in the repository. Usually you will also see the changes you are about to commit. The commit message is something really important and the message should be meaningful and readable as it will be later used by others to understand your action(s). There are several ways to do this and it boils down to what your team wants, but here are some links on good commit messages:\n\nConventional Commits\nhttps://cbea.ms/git-commit/\n\nThe same can be achieved directly in the Terminal by writing\n&gt; git commit -m \"feat: add my solution for python exercises 1\"\n[main 578e48f] feat: add my solution for python exercises 1\n 1 files changed, 85git insertions(+)\n create mode 100644 python_ex1/ID.py\n\n\n\nCommitting changes the repository\n\n\nIn the above message you can see that your commit gets some more meta data. Specifically, it gets a SHA-1 hash, namely 578e48f The hash is used to keep track of your commits and is one of the ground breaking ideas that makes Git so successful. The hash is much longer, but due to its nature it is in most cases unique from the first seven digits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAny changes done to a file after running git add &lt;file&gt; will not be part of a commit. If they should be included you need to rerun git add &lt;file&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMy submitting an empty commit message you can abort a commit.\n\n\nNow the changes are in the local repository and you can continue working. In order to share your changes with others you need to get them to the remote repository. This is done by pushing the changes. We do this by calling git push, which gives us an output similar to:\nEnumerating objects: 6, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (6/6), done.\nDelta compression using up to 16 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (4/4), 1.17 KiB | 1.17 MiB/s, done.\nTotal 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nTo https://github.com/kandolfp/playground.git\n   e8f13f4..0b8a494  main -&gt; main\n\n\n\nPushing changes from the local to the remote repository\n\n\nNow, if you were to do this on your own, everything would work and you would be happy. Unfortunately, since we are doing this in a class and at the same time, we will encounter some difficulties. After all, this is a crash course for Git, so eventually something hat to crash.\nSome of you might get the following message for git push:\nTo https://github.com/kandolfp/playground.git\n ! [rejected]        main -&gt; main (non-fast-forward)\nerror: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/kandolfp/playground.git'\nhint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind\nhint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.\nhint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\nhint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\nThis gives us the opportunity to talk about how to get changes from the remote repository to your local repository after the initial clone. But first, in order to do this properly, we need to talk about branches.",

The main idea is rather simple.\nIf you consider having one commit after the other in a long chain like the trunk of a tree a branch is the same as for a tree:\n\n\n\nA branch in a chain of commits\n\n\nIn short, whenever multiple commits are based on the same commit they (and all following commits) form different branches.\nBy default, git always operates on branches. When we cloned the remote repository we also cloned its branches and we started working on the main branch. You can go back and check the messages, it is always there.\nNow without knowing we created a branch. It is not visible to us but it is clear from the point of the remote repository.\nThere are several ways of integrating or merging two branches back into one.\nFor now we will only talk about the most elegant and simplest way, with a rebase.\nNaturally, every branch is based on a commit. In the above example 9a98eb2 is based on e8f13f4. As the name suggests, rebase simple changes this base. This gives us a clean way of how the entire Git commit chain is supposed to be read. We will see one way to perform a rebase in a moment. But first we need to know how to get remote changes into your local repository.",

    "text": "4.1 A note on dependency and reproducibility\nBefore we conclude our introduction to package managers and version control we would like to share some thoughts on reproducibility.\nIn our world of modern infrastructure we depend on a lot of other projects and quite often we do not even realize what tools we need in the background for our little program to run. Best example, do you have any idea what the programming languages for the commands git, python, or pdm are and what system dependencies they have?\nThis is exquisitely illustrated in the following xkcd comic.\nThere only needs to be one little pebble misplaced and everything collapses.\nIn industry and academia it is often a problem that some computation can not be reproduced. Let it be an experiment that you need to rerun two years after your initial run, or generate some computations for an annual report. Or the more trivial matter of running you code on a different machine (of a colleague or after you got a new computer). Such situations require your program to provide the same output for the same input. Quite often we do not think about this during the development of our code but if we stick to some basic concepts we are already closer to reproducibility. Trust us if we say: Sooner or later you will need this!\nIn this last sections we discussed two tools that will help us in this quest:\nOur code will have dependencies and keeping the correct list and pinning the correct version helps us greatly. The dependencies also undergo development and are not standing still so we need to be aware that we run on a specific version. The same is true for our own code and version control helps us keep track of what, why, and how we did it. This helps us correct errors, return to an old but working versions, figure out who to blame for the error.\nBesides these two tools we should also write our code in such a way that it is easy to follow and we should try to keep it as little attached to our current work environment as possible - in particular with paths to files - and we can avoid a situation like the following:\nWe know that this is a bit much for beginners but if we stick to it from the start we have less to change later on.\nAnyway, lets end with:\nand Python style guide - PEP 8.",

If, however, the number is a multiple of three then print Fizz instead, and if the number is a multiple of five then print Buzz.\nIf multiple conditions hold true then all replacements should be printed, for example 15 should print FizzBuzz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.4 (Difference between assignment, copy and deep copy) Have a look at the module copy and the functions copy, deepcopy as well as the standard assignment operator =.\nRun the following code and explain its output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code and output\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport copy\nlist1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], 2]\nlist2 = list1\nlist3 = copy.copy(list1)\nlist4 = copy.deepcopy(list1)\n\nprint(\"List # \\tID\\tEntries\")\nprint(\"1\\t\", id(list1), \"\\t\", list1)\nprint(\"2\\t\", id(list2), \"\\t\", list2)\nprint(\"3\\t\", id(list3), \"\\t\", list3)\nprint(\"4\\t\", id(list4), \"\\t\", list4)\n\nlist1[3] = -2\n\nprint(\"List # \\tID\\tEntries\")\nprint(\"1\\t\", id(list1), \"\\t\", list1)\nprint(\"2\\t\", id(list2), \"\\t\", list2)\nprint(\"3\\t\", id(list3), \"\\t\", list3)\nprint(\"4\\t\", id(list4), \"\\t\", list4)\n\nlist2[2][2] = 9\n\nprint(\"List # \\tID\\tEntries\")\nprint(\"1\\t\", id(list1), \"\\t\", list1)\nprint(\"2\\t\", id(list2), \"\\t\", list2)\nprint(\"3\\t\", id(list3), \"\\t\", list3)\nprint(\"4\\t\", id(list4), \"\\t\", list4)\n\nlist1.append([0, 8, 15])\n\nprint(\"List # \\tID\\tEntries\")\nprint(\"1\\t\", id(list1), \"\\t\", list1)\nprint(\"2\\t\", id(list2), \"\\t\", list2)\nprint(\"3\\t\", id(list3), \"\\t\", list3)\nprint(\"4\\t\", id(list4), \"\\t\", list4)\n\nList #  ID  Entries\n1    139708853153728     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 2]\n2    139708853153728     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 2]\n3    139708853156480     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 2]\n4    139708853151360     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 2]\nList #  ID  Entries\n1    139708853153728     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 'c'], -2]\n2    139708853153728     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 'c'], -2]\n3    139708853156480     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 2]\n4    139708853151360     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 2]\nList #  ID  Entries\n1    139708853153728     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 9], -2]\n2    139708853153728     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 9], -2]\n3    139708853156480     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 9], 2]\n4    139708853151360     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 2]\nList #  ID  Entries\n1    139708853153728     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 9], -2, [0, 8, 15]]\n2    139708853153728     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 9], -2, [0, 8, 15]]\n3    139708853156480     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 9], 2]\n4    139708853151360     [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 2]\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: The function id returns the identity of an object. It is guaranteed to be unique and constant for every object as long as it exists in memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.5 (Monte Carlo simulations with random numbers, functions, conditionals and loops) A circle with radius \\(r\\) has an area of \\[A_{circle} = \\pi r^2\\] and the square that encases it \\[A_{square} = 4 r^2.\\]\nThe ratio between the area of the circle and the area of the square is \\[\n\\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{4 r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\] and therefore we can define \\(\\pi\\) as \\[\n\\pi = 4\\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}}.\n\\] The same is true if we just take the first quadrant, so \\(\\frac14\\) of the square as well as the circle. This simplification will make the code more compact and faster.\nThe algorithm therefore becomes:\n\nFor a given number \\(N\\) of uniformly scattered points in the quadrant, determine if these points are in the circle (distance less than 1) or not. We call the number of points in the circle \\(M\\).\nEstimate \\(\\pi\\) by computing \\[\n\\pi \\approx 4  \\frac{M}{N}.\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\n\nTo write this in Python follow these steps:\n\nSearch for a module that allows to generate random values in python.\nDefine a function def in_unit_circle(N) that computes and returns \\(M\\) from the function input \\(N\\), which is a single positive integer. Hint: You can interpret two numbers between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) as cartesian coordinates of a point and the squared sum of them will tell you the distance of this point from the origin.\nDefine a function def estimate_pi(N) that computes and returns the estimation of \\(\\pi\\) with Equation 5.1.\nSearch for a module that provides the exact value of \\(\\pi\\) and write a function that returns the absolute difference between the above function and \\(\\pi\\).\nTest your function with different values of \\(N\\). Hint: \\(N\\) needs to be quite large to have multiple digits of \\(\\pi\\) correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.6 (Type hinting) For the functions extimate_pi and in_unit_circle in Exercise 5.5 provide type hints to suggest only integers are allowed.\nHow can you give a further hint that the integer is always positive?\nIs the type enforced during runtime?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.7 (Functions can be arguments) Provide a version of the function estimate_pi(N) from Exercise 5.5 that has a second argument that specifies the function to call e.g. in_unit_circle.\nProvide type hints for the new function.\nNote: We will come back to this example later where this will be of use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.8 (Recursion with Fibonacci) Create a function that computes the \\(n\\)th Fibonacci number with recursion, i.e. a function calling itself, here is the sequence:\n\\[\nx_0 = 0,\\quad x_1 = 1,\\quad x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n-2},\\quad n\\geq 2.\n\\] The first couple of elements are: \\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(3\\), \\(5\\), \\(8\\), \\(13\\), \\(21\\), \\(34\\), \\(55\\), \\(89\\), \\(144\\), \\(233\\), \\(377\\), \\(610\\), \\(\\ldots\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.9 (Working with dictionaries) Compute the arabic number from a roman numeral, for positive integers from \\(1\\) to \\(3999\\). In order to do so use the dict as provided below, if you see fit you may change or add entries:\nroman = {I:1, IV: 4, V: 5, IX: 9, X: 10, XL: 40, \n         L: 50, XC: 90, C: 100, CD: 400, D: 500,\n         CM:900, M: 1000}\nExamples\n\n\n\nRoman\nArabic\n\n\n\n\nMMMDCCXXIV\n3724\n\n\nMXCIV\n1094\n\n\nVIII\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.10 (Set, List and Dictionary Comprehensions)  \n\nTransform a list of tuples into a list of numbers using (nested) list comprehension, i.e. the list flat should be created and filled in one call from the content of list_of_sets.\n\nlist_of_sets = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8)]\nflat = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nIs it still working if we include a set with a single entry?\n\nlist_of_sets = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8), (9)]\nflat = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\nWhat happens when we indicate that it is supposed to be a set clearly?\n\nlist_of_sets = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8), (9,)]\nflat = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\nWhat happens if we have lists instead of sets?\n\nlist_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8], [9]]\nflat = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\nSplit a sentence give as string into a list of words (ignore ,, . for now).\n\nsentence = \"I spy with my little eye a tricky\" \\\n           \" list and dict comprehension coming up\"\nwords = [\"I\", \"spy\", \"with\", \"my\", \"little\", \"eye\",\n         \"a\", \"tricky\", \"list\", \"and\", \"dict\",\n         \"comprehension\", \"coming\", \"up\"]\n\nFrom this list of words, get a set (therefore unique) lengths of these words, i.e. spy -&gt; 3. Hint: you might want to look into the function map.\nCombine everything to get from a sentence a dictionary with length of word as key and a set of words as value. Test it with a couple of different sentences.\nCan you reduce this into dictionary comprehension , i.e. create the dictionary from scratch in one go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.11 (Creating a module) Create you own module. The module should have the following functions:\n\nFor a given year, check if it is a leap year.\nFor a given date, return the day of the week, use the algorithm outlined here. Hint: Dictionaries can help you for some of the mappings.\nReturn the week number of the year of a certain date, you can use the algorithm outlined here.\nProvide doc strings for each of your methods and for the module itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.12 (Using your own module) Use the module created in Exercise 5.11 and build a program on it.\n\nInclude the local module via pdm.\nUse the module to generate from a date the following output\n\nleap year -&gt; true/false\nday of the week\nweek of the year\n\nHow can you deal with european and american styled day-month order?\nUpdate your module by adding the above described function where the returned value should be a dictionary with keys: leapyear, weekday,week.\nCan you use the new function in the module right away or do you need to reinstall it somehow?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthes, Eric. 2023.
