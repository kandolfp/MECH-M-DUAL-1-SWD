    "text": "Installation\nIn these notes we will focus on Python as the programming language of choice. The main reason for this is that python is currently the language where a lot of programming for data science is happening. Other languages like Julia are catching up quick though. In general, Python is a very popular programming language. It currently ranks #2 in the Redmonk Rating.\nSo let us start with a brief introduction and then get into programming, as usually there is no better way to learn a language than using it. Python has the reputation of being easy to learn, even though not always straight forward.\nPython is a so called high-level1 programming language that was designed with an emphasis on readability2 in mind. It was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 80s and the first release of version 0.9.0 to the public came in 1991. Subsequently, in October 2000 Python 2.0 and in 2008 Python 3.0 were released. There are currently multiple supported versions of Python available, of which 3.12.63 is the latest stable release, see Wikipedia for the history of Python.\nWith regards to style, Python combines imperative , object oriented, and functional programming paradigms (more on that later). Furthermore, it is available for all major (and minor) computing platforms and there is an ever growing library of additional packages that can be loaded to extend the base functionality. This allows you to write highly complex programs with a few lines of code.\nPython is an interpreted language, meaning that the code you write is not compiled to machine code (like in C/C++ or Fortran) but rather interpreted/executed by an (appropriately named) interpreter. This allows you to write a program interactively (in the Python REPL5) or provide the interpreter with a script file that is processed one line after the other. These files usually have the ending .py. The interpreter and the language are most of the time both called Python.\nLike all programming languages, Python has a certain syntax that we need to follow otherwise the interpreter can not execute the code, this is similar to grammar in a language like English. The big difference (which probably cannot be avoided in these notes) is that we can still understand an English text if it is full of grammar mistakes, spelling errors or plain typos. Python will not give you that much leeway, but some.\nOn Linux and Mac a recent Python version is usually installed. Check this by opening a terminal and running\nand you should see something similar if not the same. If not have a look here and search for your platform.\nFor Windows 10 and above we can use the version from the Microsoft Store. If you have another version check here too and search for your platform.",

    "section": "1.1 Getting started",
    "text": "1.1 Getting started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Type along\n\n\n\nThis part is designed as a type along session!\n\n\nAs usual for programming guides, we start with:\n\nprint(\"Hello, World\")\n\nHello, World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese notes are generated from markdown and executable code (for a lot of the Python aspects). This means sometimes the results are part of the text, but if we need to make sure you can see the output we highlight it with some background color. For this reason and to make it easier to copy and past code from the notes we omit &gt;&gt;&gt; that you see in your REPL.\n\n\nLets break down what we did above6:\n\nwe called a function print - indicated by ( and ) respectively,\nwe handed the text Hello, World to that function - indicated by the two \",\nthe REPL returned the result and printed it on screen.\n\nThe text above is called a string and you can do operations with strings, like:\n\nprint(\"Hello,\" + \"World\")\nprint(\"Spam\" * 5)\n\nHello,World\nSpamSpamSpamSpamSpam\n\n\nHere + and * are so called operators. The first combines (concatenates) two strings, the second multiplies one string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe Style guide - PEP 8 tells us that an operator should have a leading and trailing white space.\n\n\nIn case we want to know more about the function print we can use another function to get some more insight:\n\nhelp(print)\n\nHelp on built-in function print in module builtins:\n\nprint(*args, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=None, flush=False)\n    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.\n\n    sep\n      string inserted between values, default a space.\n    end\n      string appended after the last value, default a newline.\n    file\n      a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.\n    flush\n      whether to forcibly flush the stream.\n\n\n\nNow let us pick up a bit of speed.\n\n1# Mathematical operators\n3 + 2\n2 * 10\n24 // 2  # Integer division\n4 / 3\n(9 + 8) * 32\n\n\n1\n\nWe can write comments, that get ignored by the interpreter. They start with #\n\n2\n\nComments can also follow a command\n\n\n\n\n544\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you copy and execute the code above your output will differ and look something like:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; # Mathematical operators\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 + 2\n5\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * 10\n20\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 // 2\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 4.0 / 2\n2.0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (9 + 8) * 32\n544\nThis is due to the fact that the system used to create these notes does not feed the input to the REPL one by one but rather as a script. Therefore, we will often just suppress the output or if we want to make sure something is printed in the notes we will use print explicitly.\n\n\nThere are the usual boolean operators for comparison:\n\n1 != 2\n1 &lt; 2\n2 &gt; 3\n1.0 &gt;= 1\n0.99 &lt;= 1\n\n# and combine them with logical operators\n(1.0 &lt;= 1) and (1.0 &gt;= 1)\n(2 &lt; 1) or (2 &gt; 1)\nnot (1 != 2)\n\nWe can assign a value to a variable and use them later on:\n\npi = 3.1415926535897932\nx = 90\n\n# Convert degree to radiant\nx_rad = x * (pi / 180)\n\n# Convert it back to degree\nx_new = x_rad * (180 / pi)\n\n# Check if they are the same\nx == x_new\n\nWe can also change the value of a variable:\n\n# We can make the printed statement more elaborate\nprint(\"x =\", x)\nx = 45.0\nprint(f\"x = {x}\")\nprint(f\"{x = }\")\n\nx = 90\nx = 45.0\nx = 45.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPython is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is checked during runtime and not beforehand.\nAs a result you can change the type7 of a variable without the interpreter complaining about it. This is often the cause of strange bugs in programs so be aware that Python has types, even though we do not always see them.\n\n\nWe have simple simple control sequences that help us to run different code depending on a condition:\n\nif x &lt; 90:\n    x = x * 2  # This section gets executed if the statement is true\nelse:\n    x = x / 2  # And this if it is false\n\nprint(f\"x = {x}\")\n\nif x &lt; 45:\n    x = x * 2\nelif x &lt; 90:\n    x = x * 3  # If the first statement is false but the second true\nelse:\n    x = x**2  # If none of the above statements is true\nprint(f\"x = {x}\")\n\nx = 90.0\nx = 8100.0\n\n\nIn order to understand loops better we first need to introduce lists. In essence, they represent an ordered sequence of values that can have arbitrary types.\n\n# List of integers\n[2, 4, 6, 8]\n# List of strings\n[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\n# List of lists\n[[2, 4, 6, 8], [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]]\n# List of mixed types\n[2, \"A\"]\n# Assign a list to a variable\nintegers = [2, 4, 6, 8]\n# Changing values\nintegers[1] = -4\n# append something to a list\nintegers.append(10)\n# combine to lists\nintegers + [1, 3]\n\nThere are also functions that can generate specific types of lists for you. One such function is range, with the signature range(start, stop[, step]).\n\n# List of integers from 0 to 2\nrange(3)\n# List of integers from 5 to 9\nrange(5, 10)\n# List of integers from 10 to 1 in reverse order\nrange(10, 0, -1)\n\nrange(10, 0, -1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote that the stop value is not part of the list but rather stop -1 and technically range does not return a list but rather an object that behaves like a list for most parts.\n# Part of the help\n&gt;&gt;&gt; help(range)\n\nHelp on class range in module builtins:\n\nclass range(object)\n |  range(stop) -&gt; range object\n |  range(start, stop[, step]) -&gt; range object\n |  \n |  Return an object that produces a sequence of integers from start (inclusive)\n |  to stop (exclusive) by step.  range(i, j) produces i, i+1, i+2, ..., j-1.\n |  start defaults to 0, and stop is omitted!  range(4) produces 0, 1, 2, 3.\n |  These are exactly the valid indices for a list of 4 elements.\n |  When step is given, it specifies the increment (or decrement).\n\n\nNow let us introduce loops as part of our control sequences:\n\n# For loops work best with lists or sets\nsum = 0\nfor i in integers:\n    sum = sum + i\n\nmean = sum / len(integers)  # len computes the length of a list\nprint(mean)\n\n# Find out how many even and how many odd number are in a list\nodd = 0\neven = 0\nfor i in range(1, 10):\n    if i % 2:\n        odd = odd + 1\n    else:\n        even = even + 1\n\nprint(f\"{even = }, {odd = }\")\n\n# While loops run until a statement is no longer true\na = 5\nb = 2\nc = 1\nwhile a &gt; 0:\n    a = a - 1\n    c = c * b\nprint(f\"{b}^5 = {c}\")\n\n4.4\neven = 4, odd = 5\n2^5 = 32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThere is an internal function called sum and we just overwrote this function, so be careful how you choose your variable names.\n\n\nOf course there are easier ways to compute the sum of a list or \\(2^5\\). For this we need to import additional functions:\n\nimport math\n\nmean = math.fsum(integers) / len(integers)\nprint(mean)\n\nc = math.pow(2, 5)\nprint(c)\n\n4.4\n32.0\n\n\nmath is one of the Python standard libraries, but quite often they do not suffice for the task at hand and you need some additional libraries.\nIn the next section we will discuss package managers and one possible solution for this.\nFurthermore, so far we only typed in the REPL and if we want to do the same again we need to retype everything. So we need to talk about script files which will lead us to version control.\nFor now, this ends our brief start with Python but you should try our new knowledge by finishing the following exercise.",

    "text": "2.1 Package management for python\nIn general a package manager (or package-management system) is a tool that automates the process of:\nfor computer programs, software libraries, general data, or other tasks. We all use package managers on our smart phones or computers. They come in various forms and accessibility like the GUIs Google Play, App Store, Microsoft Store, but also in terminal form as apt, dnf, zypper, homebrew, and many more. Most of these tools give us an easy way to work with some application without needing to know much about how the software is built. Especially in our modern infrastructure, were a build process can easily start looking very similar to this:\nThe same is true if we change perspective, from a user installing software to an engineer designing software.\nBack in the days, and often still for some languages, you manually had to integrate some library you wanted to use and they often came with elaborate build scripts (with their own dependencies, … insert recursion here). Especially cumbersome were problems where you needed different versions of the same library for different projects. Nowadays, this task is performed by package managers to the relief of developers everywhere. If you have a good package manager you do not realize the burden it takes of your shoulders. It is worth highlighting, that a good package manager can define the difference between a successful programming language and a footnote in the index of programming languages.\nWhile it would be worthwhile to visit the various ways and strategies these systems take, we will focus on systems for python.\nBefore we go into detail for the package manager of choice, we need to discuss what such a system is supposed to offer us.\nAs a starting point have a look at what xkcd has to say about it:\nHere is the (probably not complete) authors list (random order):\nThe Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)2 provides a user guide for distributing and installing Python packages. As soon as you think of providing your own package for others you should carefully study this guide, but for now, we only have a quick look into Tool recommendations.\nThe standard tool is pip and for scientific software specifically conda and Spack.\nWe are going to look at pdm (see Ming (2019)), as this is a modern Python package manager that uses pyproject.toml files to store metadata of the project and much more.",

For many tasks, the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA, the working group which encompasses many packaging tools and maintains this guide) purposefully does not make a blanket recommendation; for example, the reason there are many build backends is that the landscape was opened up in order to enable the development of new backends serving certain users’ needs better than the previously unique backend, setuptools. This guide does point to some tools that are widely recognized, and also makes some recommendations of tools that you should not use because they are deprecated or insecure.\nSource: From the PyPa Guide, as of 9th of September 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe main thought behind selecting pdm for further discussions here is the experience of the authors regarding cross platform support, ease of use, and transferability to other languages like julia, rust, or go.

At the time of writing the current sha256 is\ncdaae475a16ae781e06c7211c7b075df1b508470b0dc144bbb73acf9a8389f91  install-pdm.py\nsee install-pdm.py.sha256\nYou can check the file sha by calling:\n\nLinux/MacWindows\n\n\ncurl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | shasum -a 256\n\n\nGet-FileHash -InputStream (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py -UseBasicParsing).RawContentStream -Algorithm SHA256\n\n\n\nBy default, pdm is installed into the user space (depending on the platform), but this can be modified via arguments to the script, see the help option of the script.\n\n2.2.1.1 Optional - Shell completion\nFor a better user experience we would recommend to include the shell completion.\n\nBash (Linux)Zsh (Mac)Powershell (Windows)\n\n\npdm completion bash &gt; /etc/bash_completion.d/pdm.bash-completion\n\n\n# Make sure ~/.zfunc is added to fpath, before compinit.\npdm completion zsh &gt; ~/.zfunc/_pdm\n\n\n# Create a directory to store completion scripts\nmkdir $PROFILE\\..\\Completions\necho @'\nGet-ChildItem \"$PROFILE\\..\\Completions\\\" | ForEach-Object {\n    . $_.FullName\n}\n'@ | Out-File -Append -Encoding utf8 $PROFILE\n# Generate script\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser\npdm completion powershell | Out-File -Encoding utf8 $PROFILE\\..\\Completions\\pdm_completion.ps1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Start a new project\nLet us start a new project in a new directory:\n1$ mkdir test\nmkdir: created directory 'test'\n\n2$ cd test/\n\n1\n\ncreate a directory\n\n2\n\nchange into this directory\n\n\nIn order to start a new pdm project you can use pdm init. This will prompt you with a couple of questions and based on the answers the pyproject.toml file is initialized.\n1$ pdm init\nCreating a pyproject.toml for PDM...\n2Please enter the Python interpreter to use\n 0. cpython@3.11 (/usr/local/bin/python3)\n 1. cpython@3.12 (/usr/bin/python3.12)\n 2. cpython@3.11 (/usr/local/bin/python3.11)\n 3. cpython@3.8 (/usr/local/bin/python3.8)\nPlease select (0): 1\n3Virtualenv is created successfully at /tmp/test/.venv\n4Project name (test):\n5Project version (0.1.0):\n6Do you want to build this project for distribution(such as wheel)?\nIf yes, it will be installed by default when running `pdm install`. [y/n] (n): n\n7License(SPDX name) (MIT):\n8Author name (John Doe):\nAuthor email (John.Doe@generic.edu):\n9Python requires('*' to allow any) (==3.12.*):\nProject is initialized successfully\n\n1\n\nStart the initialization with pdm init.\n\n2\n\nWe need to select a python interpreter. pdm will search for all available interpreters on your path, if you need a different version than those available you can use pdm to install a new standalone python version, see pdm python command or the docs3.\n\n3\n\nBy default pdm will create a new virtualenv for you as this is the recommend procedure, if you want to influence this behavior see docs.\n\n4\n\nWe need to specify a project name. This name is used in the pyproject.toml and pdm will also generate a src/&lt;name&gt; directory for you right away (together with a test directory). pdm uses its default template, see docs.\n\n5\n\nThe version of your project needs to be initialized. pdm follows semantic versioning4 by default. If you do not have a specific version in mind stick to 0.1.0 for a new project.\n\n6\n\nNext we need to decide if we plan to distribute the project. For now n (no) will suffice, but hopefully by the end of these notes you feel comfortable enough to release your own package. Once this is the case, take a look at the docs and the Python Packaging User Guide.\n\n7\n\nLicensing is next. This is a rather important issue when you release software, but we need to postpone it as well. So stick to the default for now.\n\n8\n\nAuthor name and email can (and should) be a list if you have multiple contributors. pdm will try to figure out defaults from system settings.\n\n9\n\nFinally, you will be asked for the required python version. Here you can specify the compatibility of your project to various python versions5. For good reason, by default it will only allow the current version you selected in the first step. In theory you can specify something like &gt;=3.8,!=3.9.0,&lt;3.13 (a python version between 3.8 and 3.13, including 3.8 but excluding 3.13 and additionally excluding 3.9.0) but be aware that might become tricky when adding dependencies.\n\n\nNow you have a new project available and it should look like this:\n1$ tree -a\n.\n2├── .gitignore\n├── .pdm-python\n├── __pycache__\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── README.md\n├── src\n│   └── test\n│       ├── __init__.py\n│       └── __pycache__\n├── tests\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── __pycache__\n3└── .venv\n    ├── bin\n    │   ├── activate\n    │   ├── activate.csh\n    │   ├── activate.fish\n    │   ├── activate.nu\n4    │   ├── activate.ps1\n    │   ├── activate_this.py\n    │   ├── python -&gt; /usr/bin/python3.12\n    │   ├── python3 -&gt; python\n    │   └── python3.12 -&gt; python\n    ├── .gitignore          \n    ├── lib\n    │   └── python3.12\n    │       └── site-packages\n    │           ├── _virtualenv.pth\n    │           └── _virtualenv.py\n    └── pyvenv.cfg\n\n12 directories, 19 files\n\n1\n\nList all files in the directory\n\n2\n\nA .gitignore file is created\n\n3\n\nVirtual environment\n\n4\n\nWindows activation start file (cross platform)\n\n\nThe second highlighted section tells us that pdm is designed to work with a version control system. By default it uses git as seen by the .gitignore file highlighted. In this context:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must commit the pyproject.toml file. You should commit the pdm.lock and pdm.toml file. Do not commit the .pdm-python file.6\n\n\nTo check what setup pdm created for you, you can use the pdm info command, where the --env option provides us with more details about the environment/platform.\n$ pdm info\nPDM version:\n  2.18.1\nPython Interpreter:\n  /tmp/test/.venv/bin/python (3.12)\nProject Root:\n  /tmp/test\nLocal Packages:\n  \n$ pdm info --env\n{\n  \"implementation_name\": \"cpython\",\n  \"implementation_version\": \"3.12.3\",\n  \"os_name\": \"posix\",\n  \"platform_machine\": \"x86_64\",\n  \"platform_release\": \"6.8.0-41-generic\",\n  \"platform_system\": \"Linux\",\n  \"platform_version\": \"#41-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Aug  2 20:41:06 UTC 2024\",\n  \"python_full_version\": \"3.12.3\",\n  \"platform_python_implementation\": \"CPython\",\n  \"python_version\": \"3.12\",\n  \"sys_platform\": \"linux\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOf course it is also possible to import from other package manager systems, see docs.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Manage dependencies\nNow that the project exists we can look at the main task: managing packages. We will cover the basics that we need, for a full guide see Manage Dependencies at docs.\n\n2.2.3.1 Add dependencies\nTo add a dependency you can use the pdm add command, where the system follows the PEP 508 specifications.\npdm add requests           # add requests\npdm add requests==2.25.1   # add requests with version constraint\npdm add requests[socks]    # add requests with extra dependency\npdm add \"flask&gt;=1.0\" flask-sqlalchemy   # add multiple dependencies with different specifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy default pdm searches for dependencies on PyPI, see docs on how to add to or modify the package index.\nIf you are not sure how a package is called use pdm search to locate it (even though the search could be improved).\n\n\nIt is rather common for python dependencies to have dependencies on their own. pdm will make sure to install all of those as well. Everything that is installed will end up in the pdm.lock file with the exact version and where it comes from.\nIn contrast to other dependency management systems such as requirements.txt a very handy feature of pdm is that it will only add the specified dependencies to the pyproject.toml and not all sub-dependencies. This makes it easier for somebody else to keep track of what your actual dependencies are and especially for update procedures.\n\n2.2.3.1.1 Add local dependencies\nQuite often it happens that you develop a project and use it as a dependency in another project you are working on. In this case you want to have a local dependency. This can be added by calling:\npdm add ./my-project\nIt is important to mention, that the path must start with . otherwise it is not interpreted as a local dependency.\n\n\n\n2.2.3.2 Development dependencies\nWith pdm you can also define groups of dependencies that are particularly useful during development. This might be a linter, formatter, or tools for testing and creating the docs.\npdm add -dG lint flake8\nYou will find these dependencies in a special section in you pyproject.toml file, namely:\n[tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]\nlint = [\"flake8\"]\n\n\n2.2.3.3 Inspect dependencies\nIf you need to find out what your installed dependencies are you can use pdm list or pdm list --tree.\n$ pdm list --tree\nrequests 2.32.3 [ required: &gt;=2.32.3 ]\n├── certifi 2024.8.30 [ required: &gt;=2017.4.17 ]\n├── charset-normalizer 3.3.2 [ required: &lt;4,&gt;=2 ]\n├── idna 3.8 [ required: &lt;4,&gt;=2.5 ]\n└── urllib3 2.2.2 [ required: &lt;3,&gt;=1.21.1 ]\n\n\n2.2.3.4 Update dependencies\nIf you find that a package has released an update that is required for your project you can use pdm to update your packages:\npdm update\nwill update all packages (if possible) in your pdm.lock file, while\npdm update requests\nwill only update the specified dependency (you can specify multiple packages).\n\n\n2.2.3.5 Remove dependencies\nIf you have added a dependency but no longer need it, you can remove it by calling pdm remove. Note that all sub-dependencies will be removed as well.\n\n\n2.2.3.6 List outdated dependencies\nWith pdm outdated you get a list of outdated packages with the latest version available.\n\n\n2.2.3.7 Other dependencies than python packages\nIt might happen that your project needs additional dependencies other than python resources. In this case you can also use pdm to install a multitude of those.\nAs an example, you can install the Intel Math Kernel Library (mkl) and cmake by calling\npdm add mkl cmake\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Initialize an existing project\nIf the pdm project already exists, e.g. you just cloned a project, all you need to do is run\npdm install\nto check the project file for changes, update the lock file if needed and run pdm sync to install all packages from the lock file.\n\n\n2.2.5 Running your code\nAs mentioned throughout these notes, pdm uses virtualenv to manage your project. This means you need to activate the project to work with it.\nIf you simply want to run a python script in your environment use:\npdm run python &lt;SCRIPT.py&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;\nSimilar you can start the python console via:\npdm run python\nIf you need to work in your current terminal with the environment you created it is easier to use pdm venv activate which will tell you how to activate the enviroment in your current terminal. In bash you can use\neval $(pdm venv activate)\nto directly activate the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou should set up your IDE such that it searches for .venv directories for the python interpreter to make sure you do not get missing includes warnings and if you use the direct call or debug features you call the correct version.\n\n\nThis concludes our little guide for package managers in python. Make sure to revisit this sections and the pdm docs if you need them for the course of this section.\n\n\n\n\nMing, Frost. 2019. “PDM project site.” Online: Accessed 09-September-2024. https://pdm-project.org/.",

    "text": "What is git and a bit of history\nA Version Control Software (VCS) is, in its most abstract form, designed to keep track of changes to a file system. This means it tracks changes in files, such as addition or deletion, but also more basic modifications to files or directories. A VCS also allows teams to collaborate and therefore inform each other of changes made by others. Some of the main features of a VCS are:\nIn the scope of an entire file system, this is used by operation systems to minimize file loss and allowing users to restore unwanted changes. Most often, and that is also the main focus here, a VCS is used to track source code. This might be a software project or a term paper. Nevertheless, the VCS will keep track of additions, deletions, modifications and so forth of individual lines of text within these files. We will focus on Git but there are alternatives around such as Mercurial, CVS, or SVN. All of them have individual strengths and weaknesses but, in terms of widespread use, Git is in the lead.\nGit was developed as a free and open source software by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel. The main goals in the development were (according to wikipedia):\nRegarding the name:\n“git” can mean anything, depending on your mood.\nIn the following we try to give a pragmatic hands on introduction to the concepts of Git and how it can be uses. The notes are a mix of several sources but the main ideas are based on the git training by the UnseenWizzard.",

    "section": "3.1 Basics of Git",
    "text": "3.1 Basics of Git\nGit is a distributed VCS, which means the entire repository is distributed on various machines and possible multiple remotes. This was a clear design choice that allows individual contributors to work independently of the availability of a remote but still have the full history available. The following is based on the git training by the UnseenWizzard. The main structure as well as the basic idea in the pictures follows these notes, with a view adaptations where needed.\nIn particular, such a setup could look something like this:\n\n\n\nBasic setup\n\n\nIn this setup the Remote Repository is the place you send your changes to in order to have them visible for others, and in return you can get changes from them via the Remote Repository.\nLike the name suggests the Local (development) environment sits on your machine. The working directory is your current version of the files contained in the repository and the Local Repository is the copy of the entire repository (with all changes) on your machine. We will learn more about these parts as we go along.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will use the small exercise from the previous Python section as python_ex1.py file.\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Let us start with getting a Remote Repository\nIn order to allow a playfield for this class I created a repository that we are going to use. In order to get it onto you local machine, type the following commands in the Terminal:\n# Navigate to a suitable directory\ngit clone https://github.com/kandolfp/playground.git\nThis will perform the following two actions:\n\nCheckout the content of the remote repository into the working directory. By default this is the name of the repository, in your case the folder playground is created and all files are put there.\nA copy of the remote repository is stored in the local repository. For all intended purposes, it acts exactly the same as the Remote Repository, with the sole exception that is not shared with others.\n\n\n\n\nClone a remote repository to your machine\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Adding content\nWith the following snippet you can view the content of the repository (the second line is the response):\n&gt; ls playground\npython_ex1 README.md\nAs you can see there is currently only a README.md and the folder python_ex1.\nNow lets add our solutions of the exercises we did in Python to the repository.\nFirst we copy the file to exercise directory\ncp PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE/solution_ex1.py python_ex1/{YOUR ID}.py \nIn my case the command reads like this:\n&gt; cp ../Exercises/reference_solution.py python_ex1/ID.py\n'../Exercises/reference_solution.py' -&gt; 'python_ex1/ID.py'\nThis has modified our working directory. In order to get an idea what Git thinks about this lets run git status in the working directory:\nOn branch main\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n    python_ex1/ID.py\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nLets break down the output of the command. First, Git tells you which branch you are on (we will hear more about that later), second, that local repository is different from the remote repository and it states that you have tracked and untracked files.\nNow, a tracked files is a file that is part of the repository and Git is keeping track of what is happening to it. An untracked file on the other hand, is a file that is in the same directory but it is not managed by Git.\nGit tells you how to change the status of your untracked file into a tracked file.\nWe do this by running git add python_ex1/ID.py.\nNow it is time to introduce another Git concept, namely the staging area. The stating area is the curious white spot between your working directory and the local repository in the above pictures. This is the place where Git collects all the changes to your files that you want to put into the local repository.\n\n\n\nStaging area with the changes that can be moved to the repository\n\n\nBy rerunning git status we get\nOn branch main\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n    new file:   python_ex1/ID.py\nNow that we are confident that all our changes are in the staging area, we are ready to commit the changes to the local repository. This is done by running git commit. A text editor will open and you are able to write a message telling everybody what you just did in the repository. Usually you will also see the changes you are about to commit. The commit message is something really important and the message should be meaningful and readable as it will be later used by others to understand your action(s). There are several ways to do this and it boils down to what your team wants, but here are some links on good commit messages:\n\nConventional Commits\nhttps://cbea.ms/git-commit/\n\nThe same can be achieved directly in the Terminal by writing\n&gt; git commit -m \"feat: add my solution for python exercises 1\"\n[main 578e48f] feat: add my solution for python exercises 1\n 1 files changed, 85git insertions(+)\n create mode 100644 python_ex1/ID.py\n\n\n\nCommitting changes the repository\n\n\nIn the above message you can see that your commit gets some more meta data. Specifically, it gets a SHA-1 hash, namely 578e48f The hash is used to keep track of your commits and is one of the ground breaking ideas that makes Git so successful. The hash is much longer, but due to its nature it is in most cases unique from the first seven digits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAny changes done to a file after running git add &lt;file&gt; will not be part of a commit. If they should be included you need to rerun git add &lt;file&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMy submitting an empty commit message you can abort a commit.\n\n\nNow the changes are in the local repository and you can continue working. In order to share your changes with others you need to get them to the remote repository. This is done by pushing the changes. We do this by calling git push, which gives us an output similar to:\nEnumerating objects: 6, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (6/6), done.\nDelta compression using up to 16 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (4/4), 1.17 KiB | 1.17 MiB/s, done.\nTotal 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nTo https://github.com/kandolfp/playground.git\n   e8f13f4..0b8a494  main -&gt; main\n\n\n\nPushing changes from the local to the remote repository\n\n\nNow, if you were to do this on your own, everything would work and you would be happy. Unfortunately, since we are doing this in a class and at the same time, we will encounter some difficulties. After all, this is a crash course for Git, so eventually something hat to crash.\nSome of you might get the following message for git push:\nTo https://github.com/kandolfp/playground.git\n ! [rejected]        main -&gt; main (non-fast-forward)\nerror: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/kandolfp/playground.git'\nhint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind\nhint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.\nhint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\nhint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\nThis gives us the opportunity to talk about how to get changes from the remote repository to your local repository after the initial clone. But first, in order to do this properly, we need to talk about branches.",

The main idea is rather simple.\nIf you consider having one commit after the other in a long chain like the trunk of a tree a branch is the same as for a tree:\n\n\n\nA branch in a chain of commits\n\n\nIn short, whenever multiple commits are based on the same commit they (and all following commits) form different branches.\nBy default, git always operates on branches. When we cloned the remote repository we also cloned its branches and we started working on the main branch. You can go back and check the messages, it is always there.\nNow without knowing we created a branch. It is not visible to us but it is clear from the point of the remote repository.\nThere are several ways of integrating or merging two branches back into one.\nFor now we will only talk about the most elegant and simplest way, with a rebase.\nNaturally, every branch is based on a commit. In the above example 9a98eb2 is based on e8f13f4. As the name suggests, rebase simple changes this base. This gives us a clean way of how the entire Git commit chain is supposed to be read. We will see one way to perform a rebase in a moment. But first we need to know how to get remote changes into your local repository.",

This is the other way around as with the git push command.\n\n\n\nFetching changes from the remote to the local repository\n\n\nThe important part here is, that this does not affect your working directory as the changes are only synchronized with the local repository and when you try to push again you will see the same message. It does not even affect your local branches, it will only make sure that all of the remote branches are synchronized.\n\n3.3.1 Pulling\nIn order to affect the working directory and your local branches, we need to pull the changes in. This is done with git pull.\nAs we have some conflicts we need to define a strategy how to deal with them. At the moment we only know one, so let us use:\n&gt; git pull --rebase\nSuccessfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.\nThis should have worked for everybody as all of you added different files to the repository and the Git tree looks something like this:\n\n\n\nAfter pulling and rebasing\n\n\nNext we will see what happens if we modify some files.",

    "text": "Before we conclude our introduction to package managers and version control we would like to share some thoughts on dependencies and reproducibility.\nIn our world of modern infrastructure we depend on a lot of other projects and quite often we do not even realize what tools we need in the background for our little program to run. Best example, do you have any idea what the programming languages for the commands git, python, or pdm are and what system dependencies they have?\nThis is exquisitely illustrated in the following xkcd comic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: The xkcd comic #2347 discussing dependency, explainxkcd. Click the image to get to the original image source https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png.\n\n\n\nThere only needs to be one little pebble misplaced and everything collapses.\nIn industry and academia it is often a problem that some computation can not be reproduced. Let it be an experiment that you need to rerun two years after your initial run, or generate some computations for an annual report. Or the more trivial matter of running you code on a different machine (of a colleague or after you got a new computer). Such situations require your program to provide the same output for the same input. Quite often we do not think about this during the development of our code but if we stick to some basic concepts we are already closer to reproducibility. Trust us if we say: Sooner or later you will need this!\nIn this last sections we discussed two tools that will help us in this quest:\n\npackage management\nversion control\n\nOur code will have dependencies and keeping the correct list and pinning the correct version helps us greatly. The dependencies also undergo development and are not standing still so we need to be aware that we run on a specific version. The same is true for our own code and version control helps us keep track of what, why, and how we did it. This helps us correct errors, return to an old but working versions, figure out who to blame for the error.\nBesides these two tools we should also write our code in such a way that it is easy to follow and we should try to keep it as little attached to our current work environment as possible - in particular with paths to files - and we can avoid a situation like the following:\n\nSure I can share my code but I am glad it runs on my machine. I have no idea how to get it to run on yours.\n\nWe know that this is a bit much for beginners but if we stick to it from the start we have less to change later on.\nAnyway, lets end with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: The xkcd comic #1513 discussing code quality, explainxkcd.

    "text": "There exists a multitude of different programming paradigms. This is due to the fact that different problems require different ways of thinking and here programming paradigms can help. Quite often programming languages reflect certain programming paradigms but modern languages often support a multi-paradigm approach and therefore we can use different styles in the language. This is the case for Python.\nSo far we have followed mainly the imperative model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn imperative programming, the code directly determines/controls the flow of the execution and explicit statements change the state of a program.\n\n\nImperative programming has a couple of subgenres that we will explore in time:\n\nstructured programming when we use constructs like if and for\nprocedural programming when we with procedures/functions that call each other\nmodular programming when we combine logical structures into modules and include these into our program\nobject oriented programming when we organise our code with objects that contain data structures and associated behaviour.\n\nWe introduce these concepts in the progress of this class where Object Oriented Programming has its own section.\nA second model that is often used is call declarative:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn declarative programming, the code declares the desired result but not how to compute it. It describes what computation should be performed without specifying detailed state changes.\n\n\nThe most common of these is functional programming where the concept of mathematical functions is used to declare the desired result as a series of function evaluations and it avoids state and mutable data.\nWe are also going to investigate the possibilities Python provides here in a dedicated chapter, functional programming, but list comprehension and recursion are some of the main features.\nA comprehensive guide to these concepts can be found in Van Roy and Haridi (2004) and in the article Vasiliev (2022).\n\n\n\n\nVan Roy, Peter, and Seif Haridi. 2004.

    "text": "5.3 Unified Programming Language\nNow that we know about the basics of OOP and how we can deal with it in Python we can take a step back and look at an abstract interface that helps us work in the framework of OOP. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) can be used to define how classes look like and how they interact. It provides a language independent way of designing a OO program.\nSo let us extend our class Cat first with an UML diagram before we extend the code. In UML we see how classes interact but in general we will not see any specific object.\n\n\n\nUML Class diagram\n\n\nFurthermore, we can model different relationships with different arrow styles, how does this look like for our big cats:\n\n\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\n    note \"About big cats\"\n    Cat &lt;|-- Lion\n    Cat &lt;|-- Tiger\n    note for Tigon \"Hybrid between male lion\\nand female tiger\"\n    Tiger &lt;|-- Liger\n    Lion &lt;|-- Liger\n    Lion &lt;|-- Tigon\n    Tiger &lt;|-- Tigon\n    Cat : +String name\n    Cat : +List~String~ habitat\n    Cat : +String gender\n    Cat : +int age\n    Cat : -String mood\n    Cat : -Cat father\n    Cat : -Cat mother\n    Cat : +breath()\n    Cat : +mate(other Cat)\n    Cat : +eat(food)\n    Cat : +run(destination)\n    Cat : +sleep(hours float)\n    Cat : +meow()\n    class Liger{\n        -Lion father\n        -Tiger mother\n    }\n    class Tigon{\n        -Tiger father\n        -Lion mother\n    }\n    class Lion{\n        -Lion father\n        -Lion mother\n    }\n    class Tiger{\n        -Tiger father\n        -Tiger mother\n    }\n\n\n Relationship between different classes \n\n\n\n\n5.3.1 One way relationships\nBesides inheritance we can have other relationships between classes.\n\n\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\nTiger --|&gt; Cat : Inheritance\nMammal ..|&gt; Animal : Generalization\nMath -- Informatics : Association/Link\nProfessor --&gt; Student : One way Association\n\n\n Relationships in terms of arrows \n\n\n\n\nInheritance - Tiger inherits from Cat - is a relation\nGeneralization - Mammal implements/is a specific variant of Animal\nAssociation/Link - Math and Informatics call each other\nOne way Association - Professor can call Student’s properties and methods but not visa versa\n\nOf course we can also reflect other more complex relationships. An easy to understand example is the inclusion of a professor into a higher educational institution.\n\n\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\nDepartment --* University : Composition\nProfessor --o Department : Aggregation\nProfessor ..&gt; Salary : Dependency\nProfessor ..|&gt; Academic : Realization\n\n\n Relationships in terms of arrows part 2 \n\n\n\n\nComposition - University has an instance of Department, Department cannot exist without University\nAggregation - F has a instance of E.

    "text": "5.4 Principles of OOP\nThere are multiple principals of OOD and as the list on the german wikipedia is organised nicer we refer this version here.\nWe will pick a couple to give a first introduction.\n\n5.4.1 Principle of abstraction\nAn abstraction only needs to be as accurate to the real world as the application requires. For example if you model an aeroplane for the dynamic simulation of the behaviour during flight you need a different model than for a ticket booking system.\n\n\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\n    class Aeroplane{\n        - speed\n        - altitude\n        - rollAngle\n        - pitchAngle\n        - yawAngle\n        + fly()\n    }\n\n\n Aeroplane for a simulator \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\n    class Aeroplane{\n        - seats\n        + reserveSeat(n)\n    }\n\n\n Aeroplane for a booking system \n\n\n\nThis is often referred to as the single responsibility principle.\n\n\n5.4.2 Principle of encapsulation\nWe also want to make sure to encapsulate our objects as best as possible. So only allow access to the methods that are really needed from outside and not to everything, especially to properties, e.g. the aeroplane pitch angle should not be controlled by the airport.\nIn a similar way we can define interfaces. They are classes with abstract methods that can be implemented by another class.\nIn Python this is done with the Abstract Base Classes or ABC.\n\n\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\n    Airport --&gt; FlyingTransport : Dependency\n    Helicopter ..|&gt; FlyingTransport\n    Aeroplane ..|&gt; FlyingTransport\n    Domesticated Gryphon ..|&gt; FlyingTransport\n    class FlyingTransport{\n        &lt;&lt;interface&gt;&gt;\n        + fly(origin, destination, passengers)\n    }\n    note for FlyingTransport \"An interface in UML has only methods\"\n    class Helicopter{\n        - ...\n        + fly(origin, destination, passengers)\n    }\n    class Aeroplane{\n        - ...\n        + fly(origin, destination, passengers)\n    }\n    class Domesticated Gryphon{\n        - ...\n        + fly(origin, destination, passengers)\n    }\n    class Airport{\n        - ...\n        + accept(FlyingTransport vehicle)\n    }\n\n\n Airport and its flying inhabitants \n\n\n\n\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\n\n# Abstract Class\nclass FlyingTransport(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def fly(self, origin, destination, passengers):\n        pass  # Abstract Method has no implementation!\n\n\n# Non-Abstract Class\nclass Helicopter(FlyingTransport):\n    def fly(self, origin, destination, passengers):\n        print(\"Helicopter flying\")\n\n\n# Non-Abstract Class\nclass Aeroplane(FlyingTransport):\n    def fly(self, origin, destination, passengers):\n        print(\"Aeroplane flying\")\n\n\nhelicopter1 = Helicopter()\naeroplane1 = Aeroplane()\n\nhelicopter1.fly(\"INN\", \"QOJ\", 2)  # &gt; Helicopter flying\naeroplane1.fly(\"INN\", \"BER\", 200)  # &gt; Aeroplane flying\n\nHelicopter flying\nAeroplane flying\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Principle of inheritance\nYou can base a class on another, where a sub class will have (at least) the same interface as the super class. This allows you to create less copy-past code.\nIt is necessary that we always implement all the abstract methods we might inherit from interfaces.\n\n\n5.4.4 Principle of polymorphism\nLiskov substitution principle says that you can exchange an object within a program with a sub class of that object without breaking the program. Meaning, a sub class always needs to behave as the super class if you look at it like it would be a super class.\nYou can state this in nice mathematical formulas \\[\nS \\leq T \\to (\\forall x: T.\\phi(x) \\to \\forall y: S.\\phi(y)),\n\\] where \\(T.\\phi(x)\\) is a property provable about object \\(x\\) of type \\(T\\).\nWith regards to Python you can easily overwrite methods with the same name in different classes.\nWith this we close our quick excursion into Object Oriented Programming and move to Scientific Computing.",

    "text": "6.1 Functional programming in Python\nFunctional programming is a programming paradigm or way of developing software. The main idea is to work with functions that operate on their input and produce some output and are in this sense deterministic. This implies that side effects are not wanted and are therefore strongly discouraged. A side effect is something that modifies some internal state or some other change that is not visible in the output/return value of the function.\nThere are some advantages to functional programming:\nWith all this in mind, functional programming is often considered the opposite of object oriented programming, where we mainly manipulate the state of an object. Nevertheless, we can also combine the two concepts if need arises. In fact, we already have.\nIn Python we can use functional programming but most of the time not in the strictest sense. For example we will use assignment to a local function but no modify global variables.\nTo explain the concept of functional programming in python we introduce some of the basic concepts and functions provide in the language.",

    "text": "6.1.1 Recursion\nProgramming a recursive function is one of the easiest ways to show a function that follows functional programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 6.1 (Factorial) For a natural number \\(n\\) the factorial is the products of all numbers from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\): \\[\nn! = \\prod_{k=1}^n k = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots n,\\quad 0! = 1,\n\\]\nand in a recursive fashion\n\\[\nn! = \\begin{cases} 1, & n=0\\\\\n                   n \\cdot (n-1)!, & n &gt; 0.\n    \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nWe can translate Definition 6.1 into a Python program as.\n\ndef factorial(n):\n    return 1 if n &lt;= 0 else n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n\nprint(f\"{factorial(3) = }\")\nprint(f\"{factorial(5) = }\")\n\nfactorial(3) = 6\nfactorial(5) = 120\n\n\nWe can see, that the function factorial purely depends on the input n and is fully determined by this number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs Python is not (strongly) typed and therefore the above function can not be restricted to int or even better a natural number. We can work with type hints and validators to keep this in check if needed.\nNote, there is a limit to the number of function calls that can be stored in the stack, therefore the recursion is limited.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Built-in functions\nA lot of the functions (or functionality) we use in set, list and dictionary comprehensions (see Exercise B.12) are from functional programming.\nOne of the basic concepts employed there is the iterator. An iterator is an object (as we stated, paradigms are mixed) that returns data one element at the time. This is used in\n\nfor i in range(1, 5):\n    print(i)\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nwhere the loop depends on range providing the iterator interface, mainly the method __next__(). The built-in function iter() tries to provide an iterator for its argument. We call an object iterable if an iterator can be provided for it.\nNext to comprehensions iterators are also quite useful in connection with map, filter, and reduce. These functions are provided in functools together with a lot more useful functions.\n\n6.1.2.1 Anonymous functions\nBefore we look into how to use these concepts we introduce anonymous functions. It is often useful to define a function without giving it a proper name. This is done with the keyword lambda inspired by the lambda calculus. The syntax is straight forward.\n\nsquare = lambda a: a**2\n\nprint(f\"{square(2) = }\")\nprint(f\"{square(-1) = }\")\n\nsquare(2) = 4\nsquare(-1) = 1\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2.2 Map\nNow, map is used to apply a function to something iterable and returns a new iterator that applies function to the result of next().\n\niterator = map(square, range(1, 5))\n\nfor i in iterator:\n    print(i)\n\n1\n4\n9\n16\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2.3 Filter\nThe next function that comes in handy is filter. It can be used to only return certain elements from an iterator.\n\nis_even = lambda x: (x % 2) == 0\n\neven = filter(is_even, range(10))\nprint(f\"{list(even) = }\")\n\n# This is equivalent to\neven = list(x for x in range(10) if is_even(x))\nprint(f\"{even = }\")\n\n# For the odd elements\nodd = list(x for x in range(10) if not is_even(x))\nprint(f\"{odd = }\")\n\nlist(even) = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\neven = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\nodd = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n\n\nIn order to allow filter to work we actually do not need to return True or False but just something that Python interprets in that fashion. For example, we can filter all empty strings from a list of strings in the following fashion\n\nstrings = [\"\", \"Something\", \"something\", \"\", \"dark\", \" \", \"side\", \" \"]\nsentence = \" \".join(filter(lambda s: s.strip(), strings))\nprint(sentence)\n\nSomething something dark side\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2.4 Reduce\nIt is also often useful to reduce an iterable to a single value. This is for example the case of sum or we can also use it to compute the factorial Definition 6.1.\nThe reduce function can be found in functools and as we do not want to write the multiplication ourself we can import it from operator. Note, the function provided to reduce must take exactly two arguments.\n\nfrom functools import reduce\nfrom operator import mul\n\n\ndef factorial_reduce(n):\n    return reduce(mul, range(1, n + 1))\n\n\nprint(f\"{factorial_reduce(3) = }\")\nprint(f\"{factorial_reduce(5) = }\")\n\nfactorial_reduce(3) = 6\nfactorial_reduce(5) = 120\n\n\nA nice feature of the reduce function is that you can call it with an initial value.\n\nfrom functools import reduce\nfrom operator import add\n\nprint(f\"{reduce(add, [1, 2, 3], 100) = }\")\n\nreduce(add, [1, 2, 3], 100) = 106\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the other functions we discussed, we had to import reduce before we could us it.\nThis is due to the fact, that it is not considered to be very Pythonic and therefore it is hidden away.\n\n\nThis concludes our introduction to functional programming in python.

    "text": "7.1 References\nAs we have seen in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 it makes sense to pack functionality together that belongs together. In Python this is done via modules and packages.\nFrom the Python glossary we get:\nWe define a class Rectangle with some functions and in addition we include a function is_square in the file but not the class. Everything together it looks like\nand we store it in the root directory of our project as rectangle.py.\nNow, if we call Python we can import the module via its name rectangle (the extension is not used)\nWe can also get a specific resource and we can rename it\nor everything\nWe can also execute the module, which will result in not anything happening for our original file but if we add 1\nat the end we can call it and we get a result:\nNow, depending on the input provided the area of the rectangle is computed.\nWhen including or calling a module, Python needs to know where the module is located. This is realised via the module search path. When calling import the following locations are processed:\nConsequently, if we want to include something in subdirectory we can use src.rectangle where . replaces the path separator /.\nWe can see this in action when using packages, as we know a collection of modules. For example, numpy or pandas are packages, that contain various modules and we discuss them in the next section.\nIn order to create a package the __init__.py file needs to be part of a directory, to let Python know that this is a package. As example we have a look at our toy example module again.\nWe have two such files where for the module part the content is.\nThis explicitly uses the current directory and imports everything into the namespace of the module. Therefore, we do not need to write rectangle.rectangle.Rectangle to use the Rectangle class but just rectangle.Rectangle.\nThis concludes our short introduction to modules, for further details we suggest the following references.\nWe only provide a glimpse into the concept of functional programming in Python.

Some errors are purely in the structure of the code and we will discuss how unit tests and static code analysis can help to find such errors early. One class of errors you see here are Syntax Errors (SyntaxError) that prevents an application from running all together as the Python parser does not know how to interpret the code.\nOther errors occur during the runtime of the application and are often not avoidable, e.g. the connection to a database is not available, data is corrupted, etc.. In order to deal with such situations we will discuss exception handling and how do gracefully shut down.\nFor all of these issues it is often necessary that we as developer get feedback on how, where, when, etc. an error occurred and therefore logging is introduced.",

    "text": "10.1 Exceptions\nThis section deals with what to do in Python to make sure (un)expected errors during the runtime are handled in such a way that the program is not closing down in an unexpected way.\nThe BaseException class is the base class for the built-in exceptions (see docs and tutorials) and all the built-in exception are inherited from this class. For writing our own exceptions however, we should use Exception as the base.\nIn order to introduce the concept let us show some of the most common exceptions\nnumberlist = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \"a\", 1 / 4]\n\nfor number in numberlist:\n    inverse = 1.0 / number\n    print(f\"Check: {inverse} * {number} = {inverse * number}\")\n\nCheck: -0.5 * -2 = 1.0\nCheck: -1.0 * -1 = 1.0\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[1], line 4\n      1 numberlist = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \"a\", 1 / 4]\n      3 for number in numberlist:\n----&gt; 4     inverse = 1.0 / number\n      5     print(f\"Check: {inverse} * {number} = {inverse * number}\")\n\nZeroDivisionError: float division by zero\nWe can see that an ZeroDivisionError is raised for the third entry in the list of numberlist. What happened above is not a graceful exit as our little program just stopped at the point of exception and the last action of the interpreter was to print the traceback. Importantly, the other elements in the list are never looked at.\nWe can handle exceptions with the try-except construction to actually make sure that we react appropriately.\nnumberlist = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \"a\", 1 / 4]\n\n1try:\n    for number in numberlist:\n        inverse = 1.0 / number\n        print(f\"Check: {inverse} * {number} = {inverse * number}\")\n2except ZeroDivisionError:\n3    print(\"Warning: zero does not have an inverse!\")\n\n\n1\n\nThe try clause starts with try and ends with except and is executed normal\n\n2\n\nThe exception clause starts at except, we can specify for which exception to look for.\n\n3\n\nThe code in the context of except is only accessed if an exception occurs.\n\n\n\n\nCheck: -0.5 * -2 = 1.0\nCheck: -1.0 * -1 = 1.0\nWarning: zero does not have an inverse!\nFrom the output we can see that the exception occurred and was handled properly. Nevertheless, the rest of the elements in the list are still not handled. To make sure this is the case we need to move our try/except into the loop.\nnumberlist = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \"a\", 1 / 4]\n                                                                  \n1for number in numberlist:\n2    try:\n        inverse = 1.0 / number\n        print(f\"Check: {inverse} * {number} = {inverse * number}\")\n3    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Warning: zero does not have an inverse!\")\n\n\n1\n\nContext of the for loop\n\n2\n\nContext of the try clause\n\n3\n\nContext of the except clause\n\n\n\n\nCheck: -0.5 * -2 = 1.0\nCheck: -1.0 * -1 = 1.0\nWarning: zero does not have an inverse!\nCheck: 1.0 * 1 = 1.0\nCheck: 0.5 * 2 = 1.0\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[3], line 5\n      3 for number in numberlist:                                         # &lt;1&gt;\n      4     try:                                                          # &lt;2&gt;  \n----&gt; 5         inverse = 1.0 / number                                    # &lt;2&gt;\n      6         print(f\"Check: {inverse} * {number} = {inverse * number}\")# &lt;2&gt;\n      7     except ZeroDivisionError:                                     # &lt;3&gt;\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'float' and 'str'\nNow everything works as expected and we see our second error TypeError happen for \"a\" in the list.

In this section we introduce the pathlib module as a structure and pythonic way to deal with paths. Furthermore, we show some basic file read and write interaction to round off the topic.\nThe module pathlib allows us to move away from paths as strings and combines all the file and path operations into a single module, where a path is represented by the class Path. Before pathlib these operations where spread over os, glob, and shutil. Furthermore, pathlib provides a cross-platform way to read, write, move, and delete files.\nThe main object we are going to work with is Path, which is a superclass of PosixPath and WindowsPath and the platform agnostic version of a file system path.\nLet us look at an example here first, we always call the same function on different systems:\nAs we can see from the different outputs per platform, the module takes care of the differences but allows us a unified experience.\nOf course we can define our path via a string and convert it back to a string.\nAgain, pathlib will make sure to respect the platform specifics.\nIf we want to join paths we can use the / operator\nor joinpath()\nAs mentioned we can use the same interface for file access so\nwill allow us to read the first line of the introduction to these notes. We can use the usual functions to read as bytes or with a specific encoding like utf-8.\nHave a look into the following references to get an idea of the further possibilities and to help you solve the exercises in the appendix.\nYou can find further information in the following sources:",

By separating the application form the infrastructure it allows you to develop independent of the platform the container is running on later.\nThe docker platform allows you to run many applications in isolated environments in so called containers. This allows you to split up your application into different containers, for example the database is separate from your application and so forth. This allows you to update different parts independently from each other and revert changes if required. This approach is often summed up under the term micro services.\nDocker uses a specific architecture to achieve this, see Figure 15.1.\nMainly docker consists of a client docker and server dockerd (docker daemon) approach.",

Furthermore, it is able to communicate with other daemons.\n\n\n15.1.2 The Docker client\nThe docker client is your way to interact with Docker. Instructions like docker pull are sent as an API call to dockerd and executed there. The daemon that you communicate with does not necessarily be on the local machine nor does it always have to be the same.\n\n\n15.1.3 The Docker registries\nThe Docker registries are separate and strictly speaking not necessary for you to use Docker. There purpose is to store Docker images. This can be public like Docker Hub and Autamus1 or private for your organisation and tools like GitLab provide registries as well.\nWhen you use a command like docker pull you pull an image from a registry and with docker push you push it to a registry, the same as with Git.\nAgain, the client can talk to multiple registries.\nThe various docker objects in the above image are\n\n\n15.1.4 Images\n\nAn image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.\n\nIn order to build you own image you need a so called Dockerfile which uses a specific syntax to allow the Docker daemon to build an image from it. Each step in this image is called a layer and whenever you build an image only the layers that have changed need to be rebuild.\n\n\n15.1.5 Container\n\nA container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.\n\nThe container is isolated from the host machine due to the use of namespaces but you can allow interaction with the host machine like opening a network port or mounting a directory into the image.\n\nA container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that are not stored in persistent storage disappear.",

We will get a Jupyter Lab image and install additional resources as well as additional kernels,\n\n\n15.2.2 Jupyter Lab images\nThe Jupyter project provides us with a lot of Docker images on Docker Hub.\nIn order to have a bit of work to do we start with the minimal-notebook By default Docker will communicate with Docker Hub so if you call\n&gt; docker pull jupyter/minimal-notebook\n1Using default tag: latest\nlatest: Pulling from jupyter/minimal-notebook\n26e3729cf69e0: Downloading [=================================&gt;                 ]   20.3MB/30.43MB\n77950dd14dd3: Download complete\n6cca258439f9: Download complete\n4f4fb700ef54: Download complete\n2e32caa4e229: Download complete\ncd2cab437071: Download complete\n7d6f92933408: Download complete\ne7f578d273e6: Download complete\nb0173d44f264: Downloading [=================&gt;                                 ]  31.78MB/91.89MB\nbd04425a2ce4: Download complete\n0580703d6738: Downloading [===================&gt;                               ]  11.85MB/30.5MB\n8213e60e2a09: Pulling fs layer\n29e508695ebe: Waiting\n9530616136f0: Waiting\n4ee249fa7dd9: Waiting\n903968ec1329: Waiting\n6cf9a67917c1: Waiting\n2bacb72b4222: Waiting\n3 Digest: sha256:109283771021997caa770d367052d5c6ff640a76f8ace0bb3e60d8710fdddd8a\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest\ndocker.io/jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest\n\n1\n\nWhen you store an image in a registry it gets a tag or image id, where the tag is usually a human readable alias to an image id. This is very similar to the commit id in Git. In fact it is again a hash, this time with a SHA256 of the image’s JSON configuration.\n\n2\n\nThe next lines all look similar. An image ID and than the status (Downloading, Download complete, Pulling fs layer, Waiting).\nWe can see that an image is not a single file but consists of multiple images that in return consist of layers. Each layer is packed as an tar ball (similar to zip).\n\n3\n\nHere, and with the additional two lines, the Docker daemon tells us what image was downloaded, from where, and if the download was a success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA note of caution right away. Please be careful when working with Docker! As you could see there is no need to log in to get an image and we also don’t directly see what these images do. Don’t just randomly run images without considering the risks! When you base your image on something be careful that the source is trustworthy. In this case Docker Hub helps us as jupyter is a verified source.\n\n\nNow we have the image and we can run it. Let us do so by calling:\n\n\n15.2.3 Running the first instance\n&gt; docker run jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest\nEntered start.sh with args: jupyter lab\nExecuting the command: jupyter lab\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.282 ServerApp] jupyter_server_terminals | extension was successfully linked.\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.285 ServerApp] jupyterlab | extension was successfully linked.\n[W 2023-01-05 14:33:26.286 NotebookApp] 'ip' has moved from NotebookApp to ServerApp. This config will be passed to ServerApp. Be sure to update your config before our next release.\n[W 2023-01-05 14:33:26.286 NotebookApp] 'port' has moved from NotebookApp to ServerApp. This config will be passed to ServerApp. Be sure to update your config before our next release.\n[W 2023-01-05 14:33:26.286 NotebookApp] 'port' has moved from NotebookApp to ServerApp. This config will be passed to ServerApp. Be sure to update your config before our next release.\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.288 ServerApp] nbclassic | extension was successfully linked.\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.288 ServerApp] Writing Jupyter server cookie secret to /home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jupyter_cookie_secret\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.401 ServerApp] notebook_shim | extension was successfully linked.\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.512 ServerApp] notebook_shim | extension was successfully loaded.\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.513 ServerApp] jupyter_server_terminals | extension was successfully loaded.\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.513 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/jupyterlab\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.513 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /opt/conda/share/jupyter/lab\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.515 ServerApp] jupyterlab | extension was successfully loaded.\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.517 ServerApp] nbclassic | extension was successfully loaded.\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.517 ServerApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/jovyan\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.517 ServerApp] Jupyter Server 2.0.6 is running at:\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.517 ServerApp] http://b702c7cbc0b9:8888/lab?token=074a04006ad89060e18cfc1bb3814d323741a832d2dcaa88\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.517 ServerApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=074a04006ad89060e18cfc1bb3814d323741a832d2dcaa88\n[I 2023-01-05 14:33:26.517 ServerApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).\n[C 2023-01-05 14:33:26.519 ServerApp] \n    \n    To access the server, open this file in a browser:\n        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-7-open.html\n    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:\n        http://b702c7cbc0b9:8888/lab?token=074a04006ad89060e18cfc1bb3814d323741a832d2dcaa88\n     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=074a04006ad89060e18cfc1bb3814d323741a832d2dcaa88\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe :latest is not required as this is the only image you have here, but to have the syntax correct from the start never hurts.\n\n\nYou see a couple of log messages and at the end you are invited to access the server via http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=&lt;token&gt;\nIf you try this you will see that the page can not be reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Do you have any idea why?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier a container is separated from the host resources.

There are several commands in Linux to list open ports one possibility is netstat -lntup\nThe Jupyter Lab Server tries to communicate on port 8888 but on its local host, which is not the host machine.\n\n\n\nIn order to interface with the container we need to establish the connection to the port.

[])\n  -u, --user string                    Username or UID (format: &lt;name|uid&gt;[:&lt;group|gid&gt;])\n      --userns string                  User namespace to use\n      --uts string                     UTS namespace to use\n  -v, --volume list                    Bind mount a volume\n      --volume-driver string           Optional volume driver for the container\n      --volumes-from list              Mount volumes from the specified container(s)\n  -w, --workdir string                 Working directory inside the container\nYou have a look at\n-p, --publish list                   Publish a container's port(s) to the host\nand with a bit more help from the Docs you figure out the syntax with &lt;port host&gt;:&lt;port container&gt; and we run:\n&gt; docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/minimal-notebook\nand you have access to the Jupyter Lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Server itself does not know what port you use on your host machine and therefore it will always tell you to connect to http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=&lt;token&gt;, unless you tell it to change this.\n\n\nNow you can use it just like any other Jupyter lab instance with - most likely - the latest version of Python (3.10.8 when typing these notes).\n\n\n15.2.4 Looking around in the container\nObviously, the first thing you want to do is to have a look and run your latest homework. Nevertheless, checking in the Terminal (you find it in the Launcher under Other) where you currently are located with a quick pwd you will get the following\n(base) jovyan@0648fadeef68:~$ pwd\n/home/jovyan\nUnless your parents are big fans your name is not jovyan and you have no user on your host machine with that name.\nThis is actually your container file system and user management. You can spot it right away in the terminal prompt. &lt;user name&gt;@&lt;container id&gt;: and you can verify it by listing all the containers currently running. With an educated guess you try to find the command:\n&gt; docker --help | grep List\n  images      List images\n  port        List port mappings or a specific mapping for the container\n  ps          List containers\nand run\ndocker ps\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                                       NAMES\n0648fadeef68   jupyter/minimal-notebook   \"tini -g -- start-no…\"   24 minutes ago   Up 24 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:8888-&gt;8888/tcp, :::8888-&gt;8888/tcp   suspicious_solomon\nNow you know what is happening but you still can not run your files. If you have a look around in the file navigation you will not get lucky either. Again, the container separates the file systems by default. But no need to despair, the file browser has an upload feature and you go for that.\nYou can open your file make some changes and save them again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens if we restart the container?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content inside a container is not persistent. Meaning, if a new container is created from an image (which is done by the docker run command) the previous changes are no longer visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.5 Bind mounting data into the container\nWith another educated guess you figure out the option to do a bind mount inside the container.\n&gt; docker run --help | grep mount\n      --mount mount                    Attach a filesystem mount to the container\n  -v, --volume list                    Bind mount a volume\nSo you run your container again with\n&gt; docker run -p 8888:8888 -v \"${PWD}\":/home/jovyan/work jupyter/minimal-notebook\nand when navigating to the work folder you see everything in the local directory (on the host) you ran the container.\nChanges done to files in this directory are now also visible on the host machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember that you are nevertheless inside a container. This means all your action - including storing data - are run by the user that is present in the container.\n(base) jovyan@82a302b74f60:~/work$ id\nuid=1000(jovyan) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)\nAs a consequence, files that do not have these access rights will not be shown and if you save a file it will belong to user 1000 on the host machine, whoever that is. If your host user is different you can change the user inside the container by adding the option --user &lt;uid&gt;:&lt;gid&gt; to the run command.\n\n\n\n\n15.2.6 Dockerfile\nNow that you have all this in order you run your examples but are greeted with the response that numpy is not available. Of course you can install it in the terminal - via pip - or directly via Python but next time you start the image you need to do it again.\nSo we decide to create a new image and use that instead. A new image is created with a Dockerfile, seeDockerfile reference for full details.\nSo we create a the file Dockerfile with the following content, see Documentation\n# Start from a core stack version\nFROM jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest\n# Install in the default python3 environment\nRUN pip install --quiet --no-cache-dir 'numpy' && \\\n    fix-permissions \"${CONDA_DIR}\" && \\\n    fix-permissions \"/home/${NB_USER}\"\n\nThis file first specifies that it starts working FROM the jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest image.\nSecond pip is used to install numpy and to fix some permissions that are required due to the fact that root is not used in this image.\n\nYou can build you own image by calling:\n&gt; docker build -t swd:latest .\nSending build context to Docker daemon  114.2kB\nStep 1/2 : FROM jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest\n ---&gt; f0246d6dd87f\nStep 2/2 : RUN pip install --quiet --no-cache-dir 'numpy' &&     fix-permissions \"${CONDA_DIR}\" &&     fix-permissions \"/home/${NB_USER}\"\n ---&gt; Running in 18628a817de6\nRemoving intermediate container 18628a817de6\n ---&gt; 2265b09a0add\nSuccessfully built 2265b09a0add\nSuccessfully tagged swd:latest\nand run it with\n&gt; docker run -it -p 8888:8888 swd\nNow lets do something more fancy.\n\n\n15.2.7 Add a second kernel to the notebook\nThe second language used in the class is R so why not include it into the container. Checking the documentation of R reveals that we need the IRkernel package and the installation instructions translate to\n# Start from a core stack version\nFROM jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest\n\nRUN mamba install --quiet --yes R && \\\n    mamba clean --all -f -y\nRUN Rscript -e \"install.packages(c(\\\"IRkernel\\\"), repos = c(\\\"http://cran.rstudio.com\\\"))\" && \\\n    Rscript -e \"IRkernel::installspec()\" && \\\n    jupyter labextension install @techrah/text-shortcuts\n\n\n15.2.8 Additional notes on Dockerfiles\nThere are several more commands that can be used in the Dockerfile:\nAs seen above the # symbol can used for comments in a Dockerfile.\nWORKDIR /path/to/workdir\nto set the working directory for most of the next instruction inside the image/container,\nCOPY [--chown=&lt;user&gt;:&lt;group&gt;] &lt;src&gt;... &lt;dest&gt;\nto copy files from the host file system (relative path to the context of the build) to the image/container file system (relative path to WORKDIR),\nENTRYPOINT [\"executable\", \"param1\", \"param2\"]\nto allow you to configure a container that will run as an executable, in our case the ENTRYPOINT is defined such that Jupyter Lab starts automatically. Only the last specified ENTRYPOINT is used.\nUSER &lt;user&gt;[:&lt;group&gt;]\nor\nUSER &lt;UID&gt;[:&lt;GID&gt;]\nto specify the user (and group) to use for the remainder of the current stage. It is therefore used for the instructions RUN, ENTRYPOINT, etc.\nSimilar to the .gitignore there is also the possibility to specify a .dockerignore file. Before the Docker CLI sends the context of the build to the docker daemon (remote or local) it excludes the files and paths that are specified in this file. This can be used to exclude sensitive or large files from being sent to the daemon.\n\n\n\n\nKandolf, Peter. 2024. “ULG Data Science - WS22 971001 Software - Introduction to Python, Git, and Docker.” https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10532424.",

So start with the first element of list1, followed by the first element of list2, than the second elements until all elements of the lists are combined.\nlist_odd which contains only the odd integers of list1, followed by the odd integers of list2.\nlist_zip_reverse which combines the elements of the lists like for list_zip but starts at the last element of list1.\n\nExample:\nFor list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and list2 = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], we get\n\nlist_zip = [1, 11, 2, 12, 3, 13, 4, 14, 5, 15]\nlist_odd = [1, 3, 5, 11, 13, 15]\nlist_zip_reverse = [5, 15, 4, 14, 3, 13, 2, 12, 1, 11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise B.3 (Fizz Buzz) Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).

It is guaranteed to be unique and constant for every object as long as it exists in memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise B.5 (Monte Carlo simulations with random numbers, functions, conditionals and loops) A circle with radius \\(r\\) has an area of \\[A_{circle} = \\pi r^2\\] and the square that encases it \\[A_{square} = 4 r^2.\\]\nThe ratio between the area of the circle and the area of the square is \\[\n\\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{4 r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\] and therefore we can define \\(\\pi\\) as \\[\n\\pi = 4\\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}}.\n\\] The same is true if we just take the first quadrant, so \\(\\frac14\\) of the square as well as the circle. This simplification will make the code more compact and faster.\nThe algorithm therefore becomes:\n\nFor a given number \\(N\\) of uniformly scattered points in the quadrant, determine if these points are in the circle (distance less than 1) or not. We call the number of points in the circle \\(M\\).\nEstimate \\(\\pi\\) by computing \\[\n\\pi \\approx 4  \\frac{M}{N}.\n\\tag{B.1}\\]\n\nTo write this in Python follow these steps:\n\nSearch for a module that allows to generate random values in python.\nDefine a function def in_unit_circle(N) that computes and returns \\(M\\) from the function input \\(N\\), which is a single positive integer. Hint: You can interpret two numbers between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) as cartesian coordinates of a point and the squared sum of them will tell you the distance of this point from the origin.\nDefine a function def estimate_pi(N) that computes and returns the estimation of \\(\\pi\\) with Equation B.1.\nSearch for a module that provides the exact value of \\(\\pi\\) and write a function def get_accuracy(N) that returns the absolute difference between the above function and \\(\\pi\\).\nTest your function with different values of \\(N\\). Hint: \\(N\\) needs to be quite large to have multiple digits of \\(\\pi\\) correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise B.6 (Type hinting) For the functions estimate_pi and in_unit_circle in Exercise B.5 provide type hints to suggest only integers are allowed.\nHow can you give a further hint that the integer is always positive?\nIs the type enforced during runtime?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise B.7 (Functions can have optional arguments) Let us loot at the function\n\ndef greet(person, greeting):\n    print(f\"{greeting} {person}!\")\n\n\ngreet(\"Peter\", \"Hi\")\n\nHi Peter!\n\n\n\nMake Hi the default value for greeting.\nTry calling the function as greet(person=\"Peter\", greeting=\"Hi\") and greet(greeting=\"Hi\", person=\"Peter\") and explain the result.\nNot all default values are a good choice, explain the following output\n\ndef add_item(item, items=[]):\n   items.append(item)\n   return items\n\nprint(add_item(\"apple\"))\nprint(add_item(\"banana\")) \n\n['apple']\n['apple', 'banana']\n\n\nChange the code sucht that the output is\n\n\n['apple']\n['banana']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise B.8 (Functions can be arguments) Provide a version of the function estimate_pi(N) from Exercise B.5 that has a second argument that specifies the function to call e.g. in_unit_circle.\nProvide type hints for the new function.\nNote: We will come back to this example later where this will be of use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise B.9 (Recursion with Fibonacci) Create a function that computes the \\(n\\)th Fibonacci number with recursion, i.e. a function calling itself. Here is the sequence:\n\\[\nx_0 = 0,\\quad x_1 = 1,\\quad x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n-2},\\quad n\\geq 2.\n\\] The first couple of elements are: \\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(3\\), \\(5\\), \\(8\\), \\(13\\), \\(21\\), \\(34\\), \\(55\\), \\(89\\), \\(144\\), \\(233\\), \\(377\\), \\(610\\), \\(\\ldots\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise B.10 (Working with dictionaries) Compute the arabic number from a roman numeral, for positive integers from \\(1\\) to \\(3999\\). In order to do so use the dict as provided below, if you see fit you may change or add entries:\nroman = {I:1, IV: 4, V: 5, IX: 9, X: 10, XL: 40, \n         L: 50, XC: 90, C: 100, CD: 400, D: 500,\n         CM:900, M: 1000}\nExamples\n\n\n\nRoman\nArabic\n\n\n\n\nMMMDCCXXIV\n3724\n\n\nMXCIV\n1094\n\n\nVIII\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise B.11 (Loop with key, value pair)  \n\nTake the dictionary of Exercise B.10 and write a loop that walkes through all keys and values such that both are extracted directly in the loop.\nWe have seen the for loop for lists, sometimes it is helpfull to still get the index of the list in addition to the value, write a code snippet that produces the following output for the list [\"first\", \"second\", \"third\"]\n\n\nindex = 0, value = 'first'\nindex = 1, value = 'second'\nindex = 2, value = 'third'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise B.12 (Set, List and Dictionary Comprehensions)  \n\nTransform a list of tuples into a list of numbers using (nested) list comprehension, i.e. the list flat should be created and filled in one call from the content of list_of_sets.\nlist_of_sets = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8)]\nflat = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nIs it still working if we include a set with a single entry?\nlist_of_sets = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8), (9)]\nflat = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nWhat happens when we indicate that it is supposed to be a set clearly?\nlist_of_sets = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8), (9,)]\nflat = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nWhat happens if we have lists instead of sets?\nlist_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8], [9]]\nflat = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nSplit a sentence give as string into a list of words (ignore ,, . for now).\nsentence = \"I spy with my little eye a tricky\" \\\n           \" list and dict comprehension coming up\"\nwords = [\"I\", \"spy\", \"with\", \"my\", \"little\", \"eye\",\n         \"a\", \"tricky\", \"list\", \"and\", \"dict\",\n         \"comprehension\", \"coming\", \"up\"]\nFrom this list of words, get a set (therefore unique) lengths of these words, i.e. spy -&gt; 3. Hint: you might want to look into the function map.\nCombine everything to get from a sentence a dictionary with length of word as key and a set of words as value. Test it with a couple of different sentences.\nCan you reduce this into dictionary comprehension , i.e. create the dictionary from scratch in one go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthes, Eric. 2023.

    "text": "Exercise D.1 (Indexing in numpy or slicing) There exists a multitude of different ways to index numpy arrays. Create an appropriate (or multiple appropriate arrays) and provide the answer to the following questions with slicing:\nFor a vector:\n\nreturn the last 5 elements\nreturn every second element\nreverse the vector\nreturn element 1, 4 and 11\nreturn all elements bigger than the mean\n\nFor a matrix:\n\nflip the second and third row\nadd the second column to the entire matrix\nextract the sub matrix that only consists of odd rows and even columns\nreturn the rows 1, 4, and 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise D.2 (Reshape numpy) We can reshape, i.e. change row and column dimensions, of arrays. The important part here is the way the array is viewed by its dimensions. Hint: use np.arange(x) for the following exercise so you know the positions of the numbers.\n\nReshape a 8 element vector into a \\(4 \\times 2\\) matrix.\nReshape a 8 element vector into a \\(4 \\times 2\\) matrix and directly into a \\(2 \\times 4\\) without storing the intermediate result (in one line).\nReshape a 16 element vector into a \\(2 \\times x\\) vector where numpy infers the second dimension from the data.\nUse the shape property of a matrix to reshape a vector.\nDoes reshape create a copy of the original data?\nHow do you reverse back to a flat vector?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise D.3 (Monte Carlo simulations in numpy) Recall Exercise B.5 and implement a version of in_unit_circle that uses numpy arrays, you should take the code from Exercise B.8 as basis and add a new function in_unit_circle_np.\nTo write this in Python follow these steps:\n\nWith numpy.random.uniform() create a \\(2\\times N\\) matrix with random numbers.\nUse element wise computation to get \\(M\\). Hint: True is interpreted as 1 and False as 0 when you try to add boolean values.\n\nOnce you have the second implementation test it and compare it with the other version.\n\nIs the accuracy the same?\nHave a look at timeit and see which of your two code versions is faster for which N\nPlot your results, i.e. for different values of \\(N\\) the different execution times for the two versions, maybe use a logarithmic axis.\nAre there other plots that might give you an insight for this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise D.4 (Predator Prey simulation) The Lotka-Volterra Equations \\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\dot{x} = \\alpha x - \\beta x y\\\\\n\\dot{y} = \\delta x y - \\gamma y\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{D.1}\\] can be used to describe a predator-prey system.

Use the .update function to change them - i.e. correct them by the error.\nUse the .pipe function to apply a series of functions to your data.\n\nCompute the Mean Humidity per month and scale this data with this value\nUpdate the WindDirDegree such that the values in in \\([-180, 180]\\) instead of \\([0, 360)\\)\nUpdate the PST column to only contain month and day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthes, Eric. 2023.
