# Basics {.unnumbered}

In this secton we are going to lay the ground work for our introduction into _softwaredesign_ by looking at:

- our main programming language - [Python](https://www.python.org/) - see @sec-intro-python
- our way of managing packages -  [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/) - see @sec-intro-packagemanager
- our way of keeping track of our code and projects - [git](https://git-scm.com/) - see @sec-intro-versioncontrol

We will use these tools throughout the notes.
Our aim is, that by the end of the notes you will use them without a second thought.

::: {.callout-note}
As mentioned earlier, these notes assume that you have some basic knowledge of programming and we build on that knowledge to widen your horizon.

At the end of this part you will also find an @sec-intro-epilog where we bind them all together with some final thoughts.
