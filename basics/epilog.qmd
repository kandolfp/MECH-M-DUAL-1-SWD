## A note on dependency and reproducibility {#sec-intro-pm-reproducibility}

Before we conclude our notes on _package managers_ we should discuss **reproducibility**.

In our world of modern infrastructure we depend on a lot of other projects and quite often we do not even realize what tools we need in the background for our little program to run. 

This is exquisitely illustrated in the following [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com).

There only needs to be one little pebble misplaced and everything collapses.
A package manager helps you 

In industry and academia it is often a problem that some computation can not be reproduces.
Let it be an experiment that you need to rerun two years after your initial run, or generate some computations for an annual report.
You will require your program to provide the same output for the same input. 



To large extend this is also the case for reproducibility of work, your own and the one performed by your code.
Having a properly managed project is a foundation that will help you to achieve this goal more easily.
The hole point of having a proper package management is to be able to copy your project to a new computer and setup your environment as quickly as possible to allow your code to function properly.
