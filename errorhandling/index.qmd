# Runtime stability {.unnumbered}

When we write code there are going to be errors in different parts of the software at hand.
Some errors are purely in the structure of the code and we will discuss how **unit tests** and **static code analysis** can help to find such errors early.
One class of errors you see here are _Syntax Errors_ (`SyntaxError`) that prevents an application from running all together as the Python parser does not know how to interpret the code. 

Other errors occur during the runtime of the application and are often not avoidable, e.g. the connection to a database is not available, data is corrupted, etc..
In order to deal with such situations we will discuss **exception handling** and how do _gracefully shut down_. 

For all of these issues it is often necessary that we as developer get feedback on how, where, when, etc. an error occurred and therefore **logging** is introduced.
